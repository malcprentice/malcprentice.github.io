# Read for Research 
When you need to read for information, not for language learning. 

## Is it online? Download it! 
* Things online change a lot. 
* Download the PDF, or "Print as PDF" 
* Rename it so you can find it easily later 
* Put it in your folder for this project 

## Before you read, get your brain ready:
* What do you already know about the topic?
* What do you think you will learn? 

## Skim it
* the first sentence
* the thesis statement (if there is one - look at the end of the introduction)
* the section headings (if there are any)
* the words under any charts or photos 
* the conclusion
## Read it and highlight
* Highlight important phrases
* Highlight important quotes.
* Optional - name your highlight
    * write in margin/comment keywords on highlight 
    * to help you find/remember it later. 

## Read it again and take notes
* Choose - are you going to write or type?
* Choose - are you doing to use Japanese or English?
    * (Up to you, unless I ask you to use English)
    * (if you use English, don't copy paste!)
* Keep your notes short
    * Choose only the IMPORTANT highlights you need for your summary
    * Don't copy-paste the whole phrase!
    * Use the keywords you wrote. Add more if those are not clear
    * If you do copy a quote, use quote marks so you remember it's not your words
* Give page numbers if the original is very long
* Use Note English
    * Notes should be FAST to write and FAST to read:
    * No sentences!
    * Remove unnecessary words (a, he, on, in, the, is, are)
    * Make it quicker to write and to read:
        * "Two thirds of growth at Pepsi came from better foods"
        * "two thirds growth Pepsi frm better foods"
        * "2/3 growth @ Pepsi = better foods"

## Stop and think - add your own ideas
* Anything you disagree with? 
* Any connections to other things you have read? 
* Should you use this article? Is it a good source []()
* What did the article NOT tell you? (What should you look at next?)
* Now take notes on language (e.g. useful words and phrases for later)
* Do the APA reference now - it will save  time later. []()
* Write a summary now - it will save time later. []()
