# Invention - Citation and References, Other Rules

## There are a lot of small annoying rules. 
* If they're common, they are on the Invention Checklist (part of the essay checklist, but works for presentations too). 
* If they're not common (only some students need to know this sometime), they are here so they don't make the main worksheets confusing. 

## Citation: Direct quotes (" ") from a book need the page number(s)
* "Something something" (Suzuki, 2002, p.23)
* "Penguins are great" (Suzuki, 2010, pp. 25-26)
* Suzuki (2002, p.23) says "something something".
* According to Suzuki (2013, April 16), "something something is something".

## Citation:  One fact with more than one citation? Use semicolons
* (Smith, 2003; Ellis & Jones, 2004)
* ~~(Smith, 2003)(Ellis & Jones, 2004)~~

## Citation: "and"
* Use "&"  INSIDE brackets. Use "and" OUTSIDE brackets. 
* English is great (Smith & Suzuki, 2010).
* Smith and Suzuki (2010) say that English is great.
* ~~(Smith and Suzuki, 2010).~~
* ~~Smith & Suzuki (2010) say~~
* This is for citations. In [Reference](Invention-CitationAndReferencesGeneralRules), always use "&"

## Citation:  Acronyms like "UNESCO" or "SUA"?
* First time  
    * In brackets (United Nations High Commision for Refugees [UNHCR], 2000)
    * Sentence style: "The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) helps refugees (UNHCR, 2000)
* After that, just use "The UNHCR" or "(UNHCR, 2000)"

## Citation:  More than 1 author (APA7)
* 1 author
    * Chocolate is great (Suzuki, 2010)
    * Suzuki (2010) says that English is great.
* 2 authors. 
    * Give both. Use "&" inside brackets but "and" outside
    * Chocolate is great (Suzuki & Smith, 2010)
    * According to Suzuki and Smith (2010), cats are great.
* 3+ authors. 
    * Give only first. Use "et al.". Careful about period and comma. 
    * Chocolate is great (Suzuki et al., 2010)
    * According to Suzuki et al. (2010), cats are great.
    * However, you can add more names to avoid using a/b
        * For example this: 
            * (Suzuki, Yamazaki & Smith, 2010)
            * (Suzuki, Yamazaki & Tanaka, 2010)
        * Is better than this:
            * (Suzuki et al., 2010a)
            * (Suzuki et al., 2010b)

## Citation: Be careful using full names
* OK: "However, an article written by Albert Einstein (1929) argued that dogs are the best pets"
* NO: "However, an article written by John Einstein (1929) argued that dogs are the best pets."
* Why? 
    * Full name = world famous
    * Solutions
        * Avoid the problem with bracket style: 
            * "Dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)."
            * According to Suzuki (2019), dogs are the best pets
        * Explain who they are and why reader should care about their opinion   
            * (remember to cite them too) 
            * "However, an article written by Hiroko Suzuki, *Professor of Canine Behaviour at Harvard University,*  argued that dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)"

## REferfences - common Mistakes
1) References should be in alphabetical order (123abcd)
2) Burasage
3) Don't copy paste fonts or spacing - all references should look the sam.e   
4) The reference list matches the references used. 
    * Nothing in text that isn't in list. 
    * Nothing in list that isn't in the text 
    * 5 names in text = 5  matching names in references
5) Double check Title Case and Italics
6) Double check spaces, commas, and periods. 
7) One date. Not two dates or zero dates. You don't need "retrieved" if you have brackets date.
8) No first names Suzuki, H. never Hiroko, S. 
9) Online news has italics in different place than paper newspapers. 
10) Ignore case. Japan Times, never JAPAN TIMES or japantimes, even if that' what it looks like on the newspaper. 
11) Triple check Italics and Title case. 

## TItle case and italics is the most common of common problems. 
* Italics in APA = the thing you hold in your hand (Newspaper article, Magazine article , book)
* Title Case in APA = a collection of work by many people (Newspaper, Magazine, Website)
* If you have to rip it out of something to hold it, it's not italics. 
* If it is a single article, not a collection, it is not TItle Case 


|Type        | *You hold this = italics*                               | You do not hold = no italics
|---         |---                                                      |---
|Book        |*Title of the book* you hold                             |the chapter title you don't rip out
|Magazine    |*Title of the magazine* you hold                         |the article title you don't rip out
|newspaper   |*Title of the newspaper* you hold                        |the article title you don't rip out
|news website |*Title of the article title* you *could* print and hold |the news group - you couldn't print the whole site
|normal website |*The title of the page* you *could* print and hold    |the site name - you couldn't print the whole site
|Journal article |*The journal NAME and bound VOLUME number*           |The issue, article, or page number


|Type        |Collection - Title Case                    |Not a collection = no title case
|---         |---                                        |---
|News        |*Newspaper Title*                          |article title
|Journal     |*Journal Title*                            |article title
|Video       |TED Talks                                  |*video title*
|Websites    |Website Name                               |*website page title*
|Normal book |Nothing - not a collection                 |*The book title.* 
|Book with chapters by different people  |*Book Name*    |Chapter in book

 
 
## Tools to help you
There are also some tools you can use, but they're always full of mistakes. They get dates, page numbers, and online vs paper wrong all the time. Learn to do it manually first. However, if you're doing a long dissertation with many citations and take the time to correct the mistakes, they're great and integrate with Word or Google Docs. The main ones are:

* Zotero: https://www.zotero.org/ (recommended option)
* Mendeley: https://www.mendeley.com/

* If you just want to check one citation, also try:
    * Google Scholar: https://scholar.google.co.jp/ (search, click "Cite" and choose APA)
    * BibMe:  http://www.bibme.org
