# Invention - Citation and References, Other Rules

* You might not need this sheet. If a mistake is common, it is 
    * on the other worksheets 
    * in the Invention Checklist 
* If they're not common they are here 

## Citation: Direct quotes (" ") from a book need the page number(s)
* "Something something" (Suzuki, 2002, p.23)
* "Penguins are great" (Suzuki, 2010, pp. 25-26)
* Suzuki (2002, p.23) says "something something".
* According to Suzuki (2013, April 16), "something something is something".

## Citation:  One fact with more than one citation? Use semicolons
* (Smith, 2003; Ellis & Jones, 2004)
* ~~(Smith, 2003)(Ellis & Jones, 2004)~~

## Citation: "and"
* Use "&"  INSIDE brackets. Use "and" OUTSIDE brackets. 
* English is great (Smith & Suzuki, 2010).
* Smith and Suzuki (2010) say that English is great.
* ~~(Smith and Suzuki, 2010).~~
* ~~Smith & Suzuki (2010) say~~
* This is for citations. In [Reference](Invention-CitationAndReferencesGeneralRules), always use "&"

## Citation:  Acronyms like "UNESCO" or "SUA"?
* First time  
    * In brackets (United Nations High Commision for Refugees [UNHCR], 2000)
    * Sentence style: "The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) helps refugees (UNHCR, 2000)
* After that, just use "The UNHCR" or "(UNHCR, 2000)"

## Citation:  More than 1 author (APA7)
* 1 author
    * Chocolate is great (Suzuki, 2010)
    * Suzuki (2010) says that English is great.
* 2 authors. 
    * Give both. Use "&" inside brackets but "and" outside
    * Chocolate is great (Suzuki & Smith, 2010)
    * According to Suzuki and Smith (2010), cats are great.
* 3+ authors. 
    * Give only first. Use "et al.". Careful about period and comma. 
    * Chocolate is great (Suzuki et al., 2010)
    * According to Suzuki et al. (2010), cats are great.
    * However, you can add more names to avoid using a/b
        * For example this: 
            * (Suzuki, Yamazaki & Smith, 2010)
            * (Suzuki, Yamazaki & Tanaka, 2010)
        * Is better than this:
            * (Suzuki et al., 2010a)
            * (Suzuki et al., 2010b)

## Citation: Be careful using full names
* OK: "However, an article written by Albert Einstein (1929) argued that dogs are the best pets"
* NO: "However, an article written by John Einstein (1929) argued that dogs are the best pets."
* Why? 
    * Full name = world famous
    * Solutions
        * Avoid the problem with bracket style: 
            * "Dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)."
            * According to Suzuki (2019), dogs are the best pets
        * Explain who they are and why reader should care about their opinion   
            * (remember to cite them too) 
            * "However, an article written by Hiroko Suzuki, *Professor of Canine Behaviour at Harvard University,*  argued that dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)"


## References: TItle case and italics is the most common of common problems, so here is a longer overview
* Italics in APA = the thing you hold in your hand (Newspaper article, Magazine article , book)
* Title Case in APA = a collection of work by many people (Newspaper, Magazine, Website)
* If you have to rip it out of something to hold it, it's not italics. 
* If it is a single article, not a collection, it is not TItle Case
