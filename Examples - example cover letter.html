	<example> 
	<p>	Dear Ms Smith, </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	I am a fourth-year student at Kanagawa University reading English, and would like to apply for the position of assistant school manager, as advertised on your website. </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	I am confident that my university course has prepared me for a career as a English school assistant in terms of language skill â€“ please see the attached TOEIC and TOEFL certificates. Although I do not possess any experience as a manager, I was a trainer for new staff for one year in my part-time job at Toho Cinemas. Working there helped me to learn the importance of dealing with customers in a friendly and efficient way, accurate management of reservations, and handling cash. I believe I can apply the skills obtained in the future. </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Should you have any queries regarding my application or require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would like to thank you in advance for your time and consideration. </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	I look forward to hearing from you. </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Yours faithfully, </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Hiromi Suzuki </p>
