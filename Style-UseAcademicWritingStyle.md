# Style - Use Academic Writing Style

*  Some rules for formal academic writing. 
    *  Not all of them apply in all majors. 
    *  For example, Engineering is usually stricter on using "I" than Education.

## Do not use "I"
* ~~I will argue~~ -> "This essay argues"
* ~~I am going to show~~ -> "This essay has showed"
* ~~When I went to Okinawa~~ -> "WHen the author went to Okinawa"
* ~~I chose this topic because I~~ -> "This topic was chosen because the author"
* "I" is OK in SOME majors' academic writing IF YOU ARE RESEARCHING YOURSELF e.g. Education ("In my class")
        
## Do not use "you" or "we"

Unless you mean EVERYONE:

* "We did a survey"                __No - the reader is not included in group that did survey__
* "We must protect the planet"     __OK, all human readers are included__
* "After that, you should look at" __No, don't talk to the reader directly__
* "When you study English, you also learn culture" __Only OK if ALL readers are students of English__
* __It's safer just to avoid "we" and "you" completely.__
	* Use passive ("A survey was done", "must be protected", "should be looked at")
	* Use third person ("The authors did a survey", "People should protect", "Future researchers should look at"
	* Use "it is" ("It is necessary to protect", "It is recommended to look at"

## No digits under 10 without units
* Use words for 1-9  ("one two three")
* Use numbers for 10+ ("10, 11, 12")
* However
	* Start sentences with words ("Twelve" or "Around 12")
	* Numbers with units OK ($3, 8 hours, 5 years old)
	* Don't mix (8-10, not 8-ten)

## Do not use abbreviations 
* ~~don't, won't, can't, isn't, he's~
* do not, will not, cannot, is not, he is


## Do not use anonymous sources
*  ~~Many people think~~
*  ~~It is thought that~~
* ~~It is said that~~
* Instead [SAY WHO SAID IT](Invention-CitationGeneralRules)

## No opinion adjectives
* Just give the facts, not your attitude to them. 
	* ~~obviously~~
	* ~~surprisingly~~
	* ~~amazingly~~
* It is your READERS job to decide if the idea is clear or amazing.  
* See [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch)

## No rhetorical questions ("Do you know the red panda?")
* A rhetorical question is one you answer yourself.
* ~~"Why is the panda extinct? Well, mostly because..."~~
* These are OK in lectures/presentations, not formal academic essays
