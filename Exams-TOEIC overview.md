## Listening Tips
* General - 
	* Having problems with accents (e.g. Australian)?
		* You just need to tune in your brain
		* Find some news, TV, TED Talks, to listen to.
		* Use subtitles at first, then turn them off
	* FOcus
		* If you get something wrong, or can’t answer
		* Shake it off and get ready for next question.
		* Unlike other sections you can’t look at the answers and guess later.

* Listening 1 - Photos: While waiting, quickly
	* Name the things you see (e.g. laptop)
	* Name the people you see (e.g. receptionist, presenter)
	* Name the situation (e.g. office, hotel)
	* Name the ING verbs (e.g. showing, explaining, giving)
* Listening 2 - Question-Response
	* If you have to guess:
		* Rhyming words (“away”, “weigh”) are a very bad sign
		* Repeat words with different meaning (“at the park” vs “park the car”) are very bad
		* Repeated words are bad, but not as bad as part 3.
		* Synonyms (同義語) are good
	* Think “When is it happening”. Common trick is wrong tense:
		* When would you do it …. I did it yesterday
		* What will you do … I haven’t done it
	* Think “WHO is doing it?”. Common trick is wrong pronoun:
		* Did he do it? Yes I did.
		* WHat did she do? They did something.
* Listening 3 - Conversations
	* Skim the questions and guess
		* the situation (hotel, office, etc)
		* the people speaking
		* the function (apologising, instructing, complaining, etc)
	* If you have to guess, words aren't as good a clue in this section
		* Repeated words (in listening and in reading) are _maybe_ bad.
		* Synonyms (同義語) are _probably_ good
	* Learn question types
		* e.g. “Can you” “Could you” is often request. Answer = “Sure”, not “Yes, I can”
		* e.g. “I was wondering if”
	* Careful of negatives
		* e.g. “You don’t X, do you”
		* e.g. “Why can’t you come on time”
	* Careful of Tense
		* e.g. present question with past answer
		* e.g. “What will the woman say” - you have to guess, she hasn’t said it in audio.
* Listening 4 - Talks
	* Questions are USUALLY in order (Q1 is usually at beginning of listening)
	* Answer quickly and then read the next question. Especially read the diagrams.
	* As always, synonyms (“from the top” = CEO) are good
	* Pay attention to WHO does things
	* Pay attention to WHEN things are done
	* Answer as you listen, but don’t get distracted by Q2 answer and forget to listen to Q3.

## Reading tips
* Questions are in order (answer to first question is at beginning of text)
* Plan your time for each section.
* 30s max per question for section 5/6
* 60s max per question for section 7
* Answer every question - wrong answer do not get minus points
* Skip difficult ones and come back at the end.
* For part 7, read the questions first.
