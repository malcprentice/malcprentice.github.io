# Supporting Examples Paragraph


## Overview
From the syllabus, "This is a response to a question, for example, ‘What is a good way to be eco-friendly?' It typically includes a main idea and two or three supporting ideas with examples."

## Step1: Invention - get some ideas

Write at least four sentences like this:

* What is a good way to be QUALITY  (e.g. eco friendly)
* What is a good way to be an great PERSON (e.g. friend)
* What is a good way to ACTION (e.g. save money)
* What is a good way for GROUP to make/do/improve/help/support PERSON (e.g. University -> refugee students)

## Step 2: Choose one question you can write about and make a plan 

* Your topic is a QUESTION (starts "What.." and ends "?")
* You will need THREE EXAMPLES 
    * Examples should be Keywords or short key phrases
    * Keywords should be 名詞 or 動名詞
    * Keywords should be SHORT (1-4 words)
* Each example will need TWO DETAILS
    * Just notes. Japanese OK. No sentences yet. 
    * If you can't think of details, CHANGE TOPIC
* I want AT LEAST ONE READING about your topic. 
    * English or Japanese or any language
    * Probably news or an NGO website. 
    * Google it. Read it. Take a note of the http address. 

## Homework example (minimum detail, more is better!)
Topic question: "What is a good way to save money?"
* Example 1) Make my own food and drink
    * Make my own bento, not conbini or cafe
    * Make my own coffee, not starbucks 
* Example 2) Get a part time job
    * Ask sempai how they found
    * Check job website - e.g. http://example.com/fakepage.html
* Example 3) Ride my bike, no train/bus
    * Buy bike parking ticket  
    * but need to fix my wheel

## Examples (Topic + first detail only)

This paragraph responds to the question ‘How do I get up early?', giving three examples. The first example is setting an alarm.  The main thing you need to do is make sure you have set a high volume alarm so you can hear it. However, this does not always work, so some people should set more than one alarm, for example my friend Hiroko sets six alarms. The second example is going to Bed early. SECOND DETAIL. THIRD DETAIL. SUMMARY.



This paragraph responds to the question ‘What is a good way to spend the weekend?', giving three examples. The first example is going shopping.  My favourite kind of shopping is for clothes, and the best area to do that is Ikebukuro, especially Sunshine City. In particular, the best shops there are Pen-GUin and Uni-Penguin because their clothes are varied but cheap. The second example is having dinner. SECOND DETAIL. THIRD DETAIL. SUMMARY.
