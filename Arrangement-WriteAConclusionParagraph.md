In summary, shea butter production causes three problems - poverty, lack of education, and loss of the trees themselves - of which the most serious is poverty. However, there are three possible solutions - the work of JICA, Intiraymi, and campaigns to promote Free Trade Shea butter - of which the work of Intiraymi is the most effective.
