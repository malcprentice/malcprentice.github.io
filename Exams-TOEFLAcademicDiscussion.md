# TOEFL - Writing for  Academic Discussion

This is new as of July 2022. I'm not teaching Writing this year, but for now I've found some resources and tips online:

* [Templates and examples](]https://www.toeflresources.com/toefl-writing-sample-questions-and-answers-discussion-board-questions/)
* [ETS Official explanation](https://www.ets.org/toefl/transcript/writing-for-an-academic-discussion-task.html)
* [ETS Official Prep - 22 questions, automatically graded](https://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt-enhancements/prep.html)
* [A Japanese overview](https://tofure.com/blog/34457/)
* Review your discussion textbook p104/105
    * The right hand column, not the questions. 
    * Look at the summary at the back of the book. 
    * Start with a 4, then use 1 and 2. Maybe 7/8/9 depending on the question 

## A general template would be 
* 1) Comment on the topic 
    * e.g. "While in general I agree with the arguments given by STUDENTNAME1 and STUDENTNAME2, I think that YOURMAINPOINT"
    * e.g. "I think that STUDENTNAME1 and STUDENTNAME2 both make excellent points, but I have a few suggestions/ideas"
 * 2) Agree/Disagree with student 1, giving a topic sentence plus 2-3 sentences of reasons/examples. 
    e.g. "I partly/completely agree with STUDENTNAME1's idea that. One reason is...Another reason is /// For example / Another example is. 
* 3) Agree/Disagree with student 2
    * same as above. 
    * Remember to transition and name student 1 e.g. "While Dave" or "Meanwhile, Jenny said X but"
* No need for a summary, this isn't an essay.
