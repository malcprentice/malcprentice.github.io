# TOEFL - Writing for  Academic Discussion

This is new as of July 2022. I'm not teaching Writing this year, but for now I've found some resources and tips online:

* [Templates and examples](]https://www.toeflresources.com/toefl-writing-sample-questions-and-answers-discussion-board-questions/)
* [ETS Official explanation](https://www.ets.org/toefl/transcript/writing-for-an-academic-discussion-task.html)
* [A Japanese overview](https://tofure.com/blog/34457/)
* Review your discussion textbook p104/105
    * The right hand column, not the questions. 
    * Look at the summary at the back of the book. 
    * Start with a 4, then use 1 and 2. Maybe 7/8/9 depending on the question
