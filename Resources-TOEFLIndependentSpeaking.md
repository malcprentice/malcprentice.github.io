# TOEFL - Independent Speaking

## Overview and Tips
* You only have 15s to prepare. Jot down some ideas.
* Speak for the full 45s  
    * There will be a timer in the title bar.
    * Practice with your phone
* Do not give an outline (I have two reasons, X and Y).
    * Most example answers do not include one, and it takes too much time.
    * Focus on content and transitions.
* This is a speaking test - use informal speech.
    * Especially, use contractions (it's, they're)
    * Example responses avoid formal signalling like “In summary” - these are for writing
* Practice using the right tense, conditionals
    * Do you prefer  =   I prefer
    * Would you prefer   =   I would prefer
    * Why did you X  =   I Xed because
    * Why are you Xing?  =   I am Xing because next year I will Y
