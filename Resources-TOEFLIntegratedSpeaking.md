### Example
* See ETS Official Guide, track 24 (p300), 49, and 70
* 
* Example 1 (possibly old style): In this set of materials, the reading passage is a message about a teacher retiring, and in the listening two students react to it. The reading passage is a message from the university president about the retirement of Dr Hiroko Suzuki, at the end of Spring Semester, after 50 years. It also describes her career as a grad student and professor in the psychology department, where she was known for her dedication to students, and for writing many books and articles. In the listening passage, two students express surprise about the message. The woman wanted to take the Dr Suzuki's class, because her father had studied with the professor 30 years ago and said it was good. As a result, she will probably try to take at least one class next semester, because it will be their last chance.  

* In this set of materials, the reading passage is a letter about student health services, and in the listening two students react to it. The reading passage gives two suggestions to fix health centre issues with wait times and unavailability on the weekend. The letter gives two suggestions. The first is to hire more doctors so that students can be treated more quickly. The second is to open on weekends, so that more time slots are available if something happens then. In the listening passage, two students discuss the message. The man disagrees with the suggestions. He notes that there is nowhere to put any new doctors they do hire, because the health centre building is too small. In addition he points out that many students aren't on campus at the weekend, so opening on the weekend would have no point.

### Example (From Purple Longman, p651)
READING TOPIC: “body of water” called “Dead Sea”

* “dead” not dried out
* dead = high salt level = hard for things to live 
* landlocked = River in. No “outlet”
* high salt because high temp = evaporates quickly
* saltiest on earth

LISTENING TOPIC: add point - dead sea NOT sea

* is lake - sea is part of ocean / opens into ocean
* e.g. North section of Atl. Med sea opens to Atlantic
* lake = 100% enclosed	* dead sea = no outlet = lake

EXAMPLE ANSWER

* In this set of materials, the reading passage describes a body of water, and the listening passage gives additional information about the body of water. The reading passage describes the body of water named the Dead Sea. It is said to be “dead’ because its high salt level prevents life in it. It’s salty because it’s landlocked with no outlet and it’s in an area with a high temperature, which causes rapid evaporation. The listening passage makes an additional point about the Dead Sea, which is that the Dead Sea isn’t really a sea. A sea is a body of water that’s part of the ocean or opens into the ocean, while a lake is a body of water that’s entirely enclosed. The Dead Sea has no outlet and is therefore a lake.
