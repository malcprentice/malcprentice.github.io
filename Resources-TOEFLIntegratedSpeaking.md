### RLS Campus example 1) Bicycles 
* (Purple Longman p205)
* In this set of materials, the reading passage is a notice, and the listening passage shows two students’ reaction to the notice. The reading passage is a notice about a problem with bicycle parking on campus. It states that too many students are parking bicycles in unauthorized places, whereas bicycles should be parked on the east and west sides of campus, where there is a sign. Additionally, the notice warns that from Monday November 1st, bicycles parked in the wrong place will be ticketed. In the listening passage two students discuss their unhappiness about the notice on bicycle parking. In the conversation, the man has already seen the notice, but the woman hasn’t. Neither is happy about the notice because it seems unfair to them that they can’t park their bicycles near their classrooms. 

### RLS Campus example 2) Retirement
* (Purple Longman: p205)
* In this set of materials, the reading passage  describes a message, and the listening passage provides a student conversation about the action they will take in response. 
The reading passage is a message about the retirement of Dr Margaret Connor from the university president, at the end of Spring Semester, after 50 years. It also describes her career as a grad student and professor in the psychology department, where she was known for her dedication to students, and for writing many books and articles.
In the listening passage, two students express surprise at the message. The man wanted to take  Dr Connor’s class. The woman's father had studied with the professor 30 years ago - her father said it was good - and so she also wanted to take one of the professor’s classes. They will probably try to take at least one class next semester, because it will be their last chance.

### Example (From Purple Longman, p651)
READING TOPIC: “body of water” called “Dead Sea”
* “dead” not dried out
* dead = high salt level = hard for things to live 
* landlocked = River in. No “outlet”
* high salt because high temp = evaporates quickly
* saltiest on earth

LISTENING TOPIC: add point - dead sea NOT sea
* is lake - sea is part of ocean / opens into ocean
* e.g. North section of Atl. Med sea opens to Atlantic
* lake = 100% enclosed	* dead sea = no outlet = lake

EXAMPLE ANSWER: In this set of materials, the reading passage describes a body of water, and the listening passage gives additional information about the body of water. The reading passage describes the body of water named the Dead Sea. It is said to be “dead’ because its high salt level prevents life in it. It’s salty because it’s landlocked with no outlet and it’s in an area with a high temperature, which causes rapid evaporation. The listening passage makes an additional point about the Dead Sea, which is that the Dead Sea isn’t really a sea. A sea is a body of water that’s part of the ocean or opens into the ocean, while a lake is a body of water that’s entirely enclosed. The Dead Sea has no outlet and is therefore a lake.
