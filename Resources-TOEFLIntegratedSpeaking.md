## Q2 RLS Campus
### Overview and tips
* Timing: read (45s), listen (1-2mins), prep (30s), speak (60s) 
* Topic is US campus life
	* University policies, rules, plans, facilities,
	* e.g. car parking policy, evening classes announcement, new sports facilities

	* give your own opinion
	* Summarise both speakers opinions if the question asks for one speaker's opinion

### Materials
* ETS official guide p169-172 has example question workthrough

### Simple template
In this set of materials, the reading passage is about TOPIC ... and in the listening two students' talk about the topic. The reading passage is about X. It says that SUMMARY. In the listening passage, two students discuss the topic. The man/woman OPINION. His/her first reason/example is L1. His/her second reason/example is L2. 


### Template with Choices. 


* Filler (If you cannot fill 60s reliably, maybe make your intro longer with this:
	* Intro e.g. "In this set of materials, the reading passage is about TOPIC ... and in the listening two students react to it.
	* Summary of Reading e.g. "The reading passage is about X. It says that"
	* Summary of listening"In the listening passage, two students discuss the topic/notice/letter. "   

HOWEVER, most ETS "HIgh LEVEL ECXAMPLES" just start with the answer, focusing ONLY on the speaker they asked about (the woman or the man)

* The woman/man says/thinks OPINION 
	* His/her first reason/example is L1.
	* His/her second reason/example is L2. 
	* Optional - use more specific links
		* "In addition, she" 
		* "She gives the example of "
		* for more links, read [cohesion](Style-UseCohesion)

### Example
* See ETS Official Guide, track 24 (p300), 49, and 70
* 
* Example 1 (old style with really overlon introduction): In this set of materials, the reading passage is a message about a teacher retiring, and in the listening two students react to it. The reading passage is a message from the university president about the retirement of Dr Hiroko Suzuki, at the end of Spring Semester, after 50 years. It also describes her career as a grad student and professor in the psychology department, where she was known for her dedication to students, and for writing many books and articles. In the listening passage, two students express surprise about the message. The woman wanted to take the Dr Suzuki's class, because her father had studied with the professor 30 years ago and said it was good. As a result, she will probably try to take at least one class next semester, because it will be their last chance.

### Example (From Purple Longman, p651)
READING TOPIC: “body of water” called “Dead Sea”

* “dead” not dried out
* dead = high salt level = hard for things to live 
* landlocked = River in. No “outlet”
* high salt because high temp = evaporates quickly
* saltiest on earth

LISTENING TOPIC: add point - dead sea NOT sea

* is lake - sea is part of ocean / opens into ocean
* e.g. North section of Atl. Med sea opens to Atlantic
* lake = 100% enclosed	* dead sea = no outlet = lake

EXAMPLE ANSWER

* In this set of materials, the reading passage describes a body of water, and the listening passage gives additional information about the body of water. The reading passage describes the body of water named the Dead Sea. It is said to be “dead' because its high salt level prevents life in it. It's salty because it's landlocked with no outlet and it's in an area with a high temperature, which causes rapid evaporation. The listening passage makes an additional point about the Dead Sea, which is that the Dead Sea isn't really a sea. A sea is a body of water that's part of the ocean or opens into the ocean, while a lake is a body of water that's entirely enclosed. The Dead Sea has no outlet and is therefore a lake. 

### Example (Template for ETS example)
