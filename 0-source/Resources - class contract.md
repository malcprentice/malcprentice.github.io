# 1) I will come to class and do the work
* In this class, if you do the work and come to class, you will pass. 
* You might not get a good grade, but you will get credit. 
* Sounds easy, but every year many people fail for two main reasons:
** They don't do the work (multiple missing assignments)
** They can't wake up in the morning

So please be aware:
* In normal classes
** 1 m  late = late 
** 2 x late = absent
** 30m late = absent 
** 7 times absent = FAIL (unless you have an official excuse, doctors note, etc)
* Online classes with no Zoom, just homework
** Present = do the homework
** Absent = homework missing or >1 week late
* Online classes with Zoom
** Present = In video class
** Present = NOt in video class, but emailed DURING class to say you are having problem ("My PC broke" is not an excuse if you only tell me 3 weeks later)
** ABsent = Not in video class, no email, no other good excuse (i.e. asleep!)

# 2) I will read my syllabus.  
* It's here: [[Index - Schedules]]
* Check it regularly - things change. 
* "I didn't know" is not an excuse for missing homework. 
* If you can't find the homework or don't understand, ask Malc. 

# 3) I know that participation is a large part of my grade
* I will [[Study Skills - make a participation plan]] of extra work and follow it to get points
* I will avoid losing points: 
** Absent  = -1 point (if you don't have a good reason)
** Late = -0.5 points (if you don't have a good reason)
** FOrget homework = -1 point
** Other things might also lose you a point
** sleeping in class after a warning (
** using phones in class after a warning
** speaking too much Japanese in class after a warning


# 4) If I need help, I will ask for it 
* If we are learning online, email to arrange an online meeting. 
* If we are in class, ask in class or come to office hours

# 6) I won't use translation software or plagiarise (copy paste)
I will explain this in class, but in summary: 
If it's 3am and your essay is due at 9am and you can't finish, then:
* Don't use Google Translate
* Don't copy-paste from the internet. 
* Instead, email me and ask for an extension!
