Please read these carefully. If you don't understand anything, email me. 

## 1) I have read my online syllabus. 
* I will check it regularly
* I understand the assessment
* I have seen my week-by-week tasks and homework

## 2) If I need help, I will ask for it 
* If we are learning online, I will email to arrange an online meeting. 
* If we are in class, I will ask in class or come to office hours

## 3) I will come to class, and be on time
* If we are learning in class
* 1 m  late = late	
* 2 x late = absent
* 30m late = absent	
* 7 times absent = FAIL (unless you have an official excuse, doctors note, etc)
* If we are learning online using Zoom or Hangouts
** Same rules as above
** If you have technical problems EMAIL IMMEDIATELY
** Technical problems + no email = absent

## 4) I will do all the homework. 
* "I didn't know" is not an excuse
* I will check the syllabus or ask if I don't understand

## 5) I know participation points (OK, NG points) are 20% of my grade. 
* I won't be absent (-1 NG) or late (-0.5 NG) without a reason
* I won't forget my homework (-1 NG point)
* I won't sleep, use my phone, or speak too much Japanese (one warning, then -1 NG point)
* I will make and follow a participation point plan (for OK points). 

## 6) I won't use translation software, ignore written feedback, or plagiarise (copy paste)
