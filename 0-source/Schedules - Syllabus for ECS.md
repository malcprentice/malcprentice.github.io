# Changes in Fall 2020
## 1) Less essay assignments
* Outlines not assessed - total 40% not 50%

## 2) Less presentations
** Was 4, now 3 presentation
** Once every 3 weeks (Teams A, B, & C) 
** Two practice, one graded
** Final presentation was 10%, now 20% (10% slides, 10% video)
** It was hard to grade eye contact in Spring - video will be face only (not slides with tiny face)

## 4) Less SR
* Was 2 books (40), now 1 book (20).  
* Half the work, so half the grade: 5% 

## 5) TOEIC required in winter
* In December there will be an online TOEIC test. This is free, and required.
* 5% for signing up and taking the test. 
* No bonus points unless you take ANOTHER test (e.g. TOEFL+TOEIC, or two TOEIC). 
* If for some reason you can't take it that day, do 2 hours "Time needed" of ALC instead. Low scores not accepted - make an effort. 

## 6) No changes to QW, but word count goes up 
* You can repeat topics but change content (e.g. "my favourite movie" but talk about a different movie)
* Minimum word count __starts__ at 175. Read instructions for increases in Fall. 

## 7) Changes to participation - ALC 
* Max 2 points for ALC. 
* Too many students were not making effort (e.g. student with 490 TOEIC score dropped from 60%+ on test 1 to around 25% on tests 2). 
* ... so if you need points, do more SAC or QW. 

## 8) Changes to participation - free TOEIC test now required
* You now get 5% for doing the December free TOEIC test
* So to get points for official tests, you must take ANOTHER TOEIC test or a TOEFL test and submit TWO scores. 
* 1 point is too stingy for a 2 hour exam, so I will give 3 points if you do a second test. 


## 8) Changes to Vocab
* No change in learning method - just continue with lists or collecting new words
* Tests will be required video ON, eyes COVERED. I can't think of any other way to do this fairly. 

## Participation Example: In other words, to score 10/10, do something like this:
* 30 extra quickwrites
* 27 extra quickwrites plus 1 EF  
* 24 extra quickwrites plus 1 EF, 1 ALC
* 21 extra quickwrites plus 1 EF, 1 ALC, 1WC
* 21 extra quickwrites plus a TOEFL test (not December TOEIC)
* 21 extra quickwrites plus a SECOND TOEIC test (not December TOEIC)
* 18 extra quickwrites plus 1 EF, 1 ALC, 1WC, 1GV, 
* 15 extra quickwrites plus 1 EF, 1 ALC, 1WC, 1GV, 1 STC
