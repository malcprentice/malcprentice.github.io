#Rules for making a slide
*No more than 3s to read a slide
**If you are going to SAY don't WRITE it
***NEVER read your slides.
***If you WRITE it, give your audience time to read it. 
**Keywords/Note English, NOT sentences
*Most slides should have a figure
**an image
**a graph
**Don't steal images! Use these [[Resources - sources of free images and clipart]]
*Use bullet points to make the arrangement clear
**Follow outline rules
**e.g. no lonely points - each level must have 2+ points
*Put references on the slide, but don't let them get in the way
**Put them on a different line
**Put them at the bottom
**Shrink the font
**Use lower level bullet points.
**Basically, make it very clear they are NOT points.
*Minimum font size is usually 24pt, however use your judgement
**FOor a poster subtitle, 36 is better (you should be able to read it 2 meters away)
**For a large screen in a small room, you can go sligtly smaller.
*All fonts should be the same size unless you have a reason
**For example, you can shrink references
**However, don't shrink text just to fit unless you shrink ALL points at that level
*Proofread it, just like you proofread an essay
*Practice setting up & using the projector / remote control / mike / notes
*Avoid using the “Presenter Notes” function
*For bright rooms with bad projectors, try a “White on Black” theme



#Rules for references section
*Burasage is impossible - forget it
*Break the font rule - small is OK. No-one reads the references
*In real life, you would give your audience the references separately
**by emailing them the pptx file (or putting on a website)
**by giving them a paper handout with references/data/other things that do not fit on the slides
*However, DO use APA format properly (italics, title case, etc)

#Rules for sending me your slideshow
*Email me a PPTX file to be assessed. No thumbdrives! No Google Shares!
*Name your file properly e.g. Hiroko Sato-SSGB-RR6.pptx

#Rules for making an essay into a slideshow
*Your keywords become TITLES
**(e.g. Problem 1: Keyword 1).
**Do not use them in the body of the slide slide.
