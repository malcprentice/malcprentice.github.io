# 1) If I need help I will ask for it
### Ask the syllabus first!
* Nearly all answers are there. 
* Check it regularly, it may change. 

### Ask in class
<img src="https://openclipart.org/download/50287/eleve-posant-une-question.svg" />
Excuse me?                      |Once more please.              |Please speak slowly.
What does "dog" mean?           |How can I say "犬"?            |How do you spell "dog"?
I don't know.                   |I don't understand.            |I can't find.... 
Could you give an example?      |Could you explain that again?  |Teacher, the screen is off!   

### Ask outside class, if you have bigger problem or a longer question:
* <blue> __Come to my office!__ </blue> Schedule here: [[Schedules - Malc's schedule]]
* Email me any time. See [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]] for example emails
* Ask your seniors or classmates

# 2) I will come to class, and be on time.
1m after bell	 		|= late          |(if I have to pick up your namecard)
> 15 mins after bell	|= absent        |(unless you have a train slip, etc)
2 x late				|= 1 x absent    |
> 6 absences            |= fail          |(unless you have a kouketsu, doctor's note, etc)

In some classes, you can be absent up to 1/3 of the course
<red>In THIS class</red>, you will fail if you miss __7__ 

# 3) I will do all the homework
90 minute class = 90 minutes of homework. No excuses! 
"I didn’t know the homework"    |Ask a friend, check the syllabus, email me, or come in office hours!
"I left my homework at home"	|Use Dropbox, Google Drive, etc
"The printer broke"			    |Printers always break. Print at least 1hr before class!

# 4) I know participation points are important. I will avoid <red>NG</red> points and get <green>OK</green> points for extra work.  
### You must earn <green>OK</green> points to get a high grade
* Mostly, this means doing extra homework. See your syllabus for details.
* You can't earn participation <green>OK</green> points for doing the minimum!


### You must also avoid <red>NG</red> points: 
* don't be absent 
* don't forget homework or materials
* stay on task: no sleep, phones, or Japanese when you should studying
* See your syllabus for details

# 5) I will keep my work organised
* Buy a 40 pocket A4 clear folder OR make a Drive/Dropbox folder
* To do Drive/Dropbox only (no paper), you must:
** Be logged in and ready to go at the beginning of class so your partner does not have to wait
** Have a tablet or laptop (not tiny phone) so your partner can read easily
** Make sure it is easy for your partner to see ALL your vocab, for the end of term test/
* Whatever you choose
** Keep each type of homework together (especially your vocab sheets)
** Don't waste your partner's time looking through a messy folder!

# 6) I won't use translation software, ignore written feedback, or plagiarise
* Google translate is useful, but can't write sentences. 
* USE comments from partner, Writing Centre, or teacher. Wasting our time = automatic D/E!
* Don't copy-paste: [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]] Automatic D/E!

# 7) I have seen my online schedule and syllabus. I will check it before class.
Schedules are here: [[Index - Schedules]]
