# Important
1) Do not confuse normal Gmail and soka-u.jp. Please use YOUR soka-u.jp address to share a document with MY soka-u.jp address 
2) There are two kinds of feedback
* If I make a comments, it's important. I want you to understand the problem, fix it and mark it resolved. Then try not to do it again. 
* If I suggest a change, it means it's not so important (e.g. spelling). Just click the tick and accept it. 
3) Never  "request access". You have access.
** It's your document, you're just not logged in to the right account
** Log in to soka-u.jp 

# Asking  questions about comments
* If you have a question about my comment, you can click on the comment and reply. It will email me. 
* Please only use it if you don't understand. If you understand, fix it but DON"T ask "Is this OK"  (60 students * 100 comments = 6000 emails).
* Please only ask if you cannot ask in the class periods marked "Review feedback"
* Please only ask 3 questions max. If you have more, come to office hours. 
* I might not have PC access outside of work hours. Try to ask questions that I can answer using thumbs on a phone on a train. Anything more complicated, come to office hours.
