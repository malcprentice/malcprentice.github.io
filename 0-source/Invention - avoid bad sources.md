This page is about research sources. For other kinds of support you can use in your essays, see [[Invention - recognise types of evidence]]

#The short version
Sources that students have used in the past that you should not use
*Dictionaries
*Wikipedia
**Any other kind of Wiki that anyone can edit. 
**Any other kind of "pedia", including normal Encyclopaedias. 
*Any "question answering" asite
**Quora answers
**Yahoo answers
**About.com
*Comments 
**Blog comments
**TED Talks comments
*Something your teacher said in class (you need to find somethign they WROTE!)

#Basic rule: Most sources in your essays should be:
News
NGO reports
Government reports
High quality personal websites by experts
Academic articles you have read (maybe in Japanese) on your courses


#How to find good normal sources
##1) Read the Japanese Wikipedia page
*Get an overview
*Get an idea of the main problems/topics
*However, you CANNOT cite Wikipedia (see below)

##2) Read the English Wikipedia page.
*Find out what the terms for those problems are in English. Now you know what to Google for!
*If you see a useful fact, click the link to see the reference. Maybe you can use it in your essay.
*However, you CANNOT cite Wikipedia (see below)

##3) Google your topic.
*Use the keywords you found in stage 1/2 (e.g. "cotton water shortage")
*Use quotes to get an exact search
*Use dates under "Search Tools" to find recent news/articles

 
#How to find good academic sources 
English or Japanese - for first year essays (not RR) I dont' expect you to read these in English
*Find it
**Try Google Scholar (English or Japanese)
**Try a normal Google search for the topic, but add "site:.ac.jp" "site:.ac.uk" or "site:.edu"
**Try CiNii (mostly Japanese): http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ja

##Check its quality
*Is it being used?
**Check if anyone has cited it (Google Scholar).
**If no-one has and it isn't really new, ask why.
*Is it new enough? Only cite older articles if they are: 
**"Classics" - things everyone cites.
**in topics that do not change much (philosophy)
**in a unpopular field
*Is it biased?
*e.g. research funded by a company making money from the thing researched
*e.g. research done by a researcher making money from the thing researched.

##High quality sources to look for
Carefully peer-reviewed articles/books are usually found on:
**Large academic publishing companies: Sciencedirect	Degruyter		Ingenta	Wiley
**Large open-source publishing projects: http://www.plosone.org/			http://bmjopen.bmj.com/
**Large university publishers: http://www.cambridge.org/		http://www.press.uchicago.edu/
**Large academic organisation websites: http://jalt.org/main/publications	http://www.bps.org.uk/publications
**Carefully managed indexes and databases: http://jstor.org http://www.apa.org/pubs/databases/

One measure of quality is "impact" - find your topic on this list: http://www.journalindicators.com/indicators

##Low quality sources to avoid
*"Self publishing" companies/Journals that print anything if they are paid: http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/
*Individual websites, blogs, online encyclopaedias, etc.
*Single topic journals published by single-topic people/groups: creation dot com, inconvenient history dot com  (links spelled out because I don't want to link to them)
*Also check the universities where the writers work.

##The above are only suggestions.
*Some small journals are good. Some big ones are bad.
*Some researchers have high quality blogs.
*It will take a while, but learn the names of quality sources for your area.

#Bias and Quality practice task
Here are five sources (journal, newspaper) from a Wiki article on Fair Trade: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade_debate
Score them for bias and quality
Bias  						|Quality
____________________________|______________________
Unbiased  = 5 				|High Quality 	= A
Maybe a bit biased = 3		|Medium Quality 	= B
Totally Biased 	= 1			|Low Quality 	= C
