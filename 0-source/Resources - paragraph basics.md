In this unit, you will learn how to write a good paragraph.  
* This page takes a bad paragraph, and makes it better. 
* For quickwrites, only worry about 2, 3, and maybe 4
* For essays, worry about ALL these points

### 1 - A bad answer to "Write about your last holiday"
> The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. 
> I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. 
> When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too.

### 2
>The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too.

* Paragraph 2 is better because __it doesn't start every sentence on a new line__


### 3
>In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too. 

* Paragraph 3 is better because __it starts with a topic sentence__

### 4
>In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too. I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better.

* Paragraph 4 is better because __it ends with a conclusion/recommendation sentence, which you need if there is only one paragraph__

 

### 5
>In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, and I got sick. There was a lot to see - castles, some museums,and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better.

* Paragraph 5 is better because __there is now one bad point sentence and one good point sentence, not two setences of mixed bad and good__


### 6
> In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. On one hand, the weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, and I got sick. However, I saw some castles, some museums, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. In summary, I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better.

* Paragraph 6 is better because __you can EASILY SEE that there is one bad point sentence and one good point sentence, using "On one hand...However"__


### 7
> In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. On one hand, the weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, and I got sick. However, I saw some castles, some museums, and went hiking in some beautiful mountains. In summary, I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better.

* Paragraph 7 is better because __it has been checked for spelling ("beautiful") and grammar ("play hiking")__
