# There are two kinds of response
1) Response in the _solutions_ paragraph of the first year essay ("However, this solution is not effective because"
2) Personal response to something you read, which somes after your summary

This page is about _arrangement_ for _essay paragraph_ summaries
For report responses, see [[Style - write a response]]

# How to do it
Summary-Response can be a sentence, a paragraph or a whole essay.
This sheet is mostly about _sentences_ for use in the summary-response _solutions_ paragraph of your essays.


# Invention
You _cannot_ do this without research.
This paragraph is about what solutions _other people and groups_ have tried, not your ideas.
Save your ideas for the discussion.
You will need to research how to:
1) _Summarize_ (with APA citation) a statement or a solution.
2) _Respond_ (with APA citation) using EVIDENCE. Is the thing you summarized
* true/effective
* partly true/effective
* untrue/ineffective.

## Example negative responses.
You're looking EVIDENCE to PROVE your response. Look for:
bad research            |However, the data supporting this is very old"///"However the research was funded by the company who makes it.
bad assumptions         |However, this solution assumes that poor children all live in cities.
missing data            |However, the NGO offers no data on hyow many children are actually using the schools.
not fully effective     |However, only 7% of the product sold is Fair Trade, leaving 90% which might involve child labour.
not ready yet           |However, the project will not start until 2019, so it is unclear if it is effective."
PR                      |However, this small project is funded by a large tobacco company, which is known for employing child labour - as such it is likely this is an attempt at improving their image rather than an honest attempt to solve the issue, as shown by the fact that they make profits of 5 billion USD each year but only spent 100,000 of that on this project ("Tobacco," n.d.)


## Example positive responses
Just summarize more evidence to show that it IS effective
* Preferably, a number (17%, 300 children, 1200 pairs of shoes every month)

## FOr both positive and negative responses, try to use an independent source
* i.e. NOT an NGO saying they are great using their own data). Instead:
* e.g. respond to an NGO/volunteer group website using Charity Navigator https://www.charitynavigator.org
* e.g. search for blogs by ex-volunteers, not comments on the volunteer organisation website.
* e.g. search for newpaper commentary on government projects, not statements by one political party
* e.g. search Google Scholar / CiNii (Japanese) for academic articles
* e.g. blogs by volunteers who actually went on a trip, not the volunteer organisation itself
* e.g. Google Scholar articles on the idea



# Arrangement
This simple outline is also on the template in the materials folder:
+Topic Sentence ("This paragraph looks at")
+Coherence Signpost ("The first solution/organisation is")
+Summary of solution 1("This is when"/"This group mostly")
+Response to solution 1 ("However" or "In fact")
+Coherence Signpost ("The second solution/organisation is")
+Summary of solution 2
+Response to solution 2
+Coherence Signpost ("The third solution/organisation is")
+Summary of solution 3
+Response to solution 3
+Summary of PARAGRAPH ("In summary, there are three solutions- 1, 2, and 3 - of which all/none/only 2 and 3 are true/effective.").


## Key Arrangement tips
* Minimum 11 sentences
* You can [[Arrangement - write a detail sentence]] extra for each summary and reponse, for a total of max 17 sentences.
* Don't go longer than 17, or you will need to split th paragraph and [[Arrangement - write a sectional essay]]
* No link - next paragraph is conclusion. See [[Arrangement - write a paragraph summary-link]]
* Remember to [[Style - use cohesion]] properly for details
* Evidence, not opinion
* Don't forget your citations


# Examples
##  (One summary-response pair)
>>The second solution is KEYWORD1. Summary of the solution or statement for KEYWORD 1. More detail on KEYWORD 1. Transition to response using a sentence that starts "However" or "In fact" which says whether or not you think it is effective/true or not. Supporting evidence for the previous sentence. More detail or more evidence.

## Endangered Animals example (One summary-response pair)
>>The second solution is deterrance. One group is painting Rhinos horns with pink poison which is safe for rhinos, but makes people who eat rhino horn as medicine sick ("Poisoning rhino horns," n.d.). However, this does not always work as the colour can be removed, and the poachers do not really care that the customers get sick ("Poisoning rhino horns," 2013, April 4).  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/04/rhino-horns-poisoned-poachers-protect https://www.savetherhino.org/rhino_info/thorny_issues/poisoning_rhino_horns

## Ethical consumption example (One summary-response pair)
>>The first solution is donating shoes. One donates a pair of shoes to children in the third world for every pair of shoes they sell in the first world ("Giving partner," n.d.). However, this project has exprienced problems with giving the wrong size shoes, and not supporting the delivery of shoes to the countryside. http://www.toms.com/stories/giving/giving-partner-interview-with-coprodeli-in-peru http://www.whydev.org/give-one-what-happens-after-you-buy-a-pair-of-toms/

## Full Paragraph example
>>This paragraph describes three solutions to the problems of shrimp described above. Firstly, people could just stop eating shrimp, however this is <blue>unlikely unless there are more health scares like the one in 2014 ("Shrimp cause 7 deaths", 2014).</blue> Secondly, there is one Dutch company that sells free-trade shrimp, which guarantees the workers fair pay ("Free Trade Shrimp," 2014, July 2). <blue>However, research shows that only 5% of shrimp are currently fair trade ("Problems in Fair Trade", 2014, July 3).</blue> Finally, we could buy only Indian shrimp, as their industry is better regulated ("Indian Shrimp," n.d.), <blue>however this could stress their industry and possibly cause more problems.</blue> In conclusion, there are a number of possible solutions but each could cause more problems - the best option is perhaps to insist on Free Trade Shrimp at supermarkets and restaurants and hope the percentage goes up.

# Style
### Summary
Who is doing what? Where? Why? When? How?
* The first solution is X (Suzuki, 2014 June 6). The aim of X is to do Y, by Zing.
* According to Suzuki (2014, June 6), X is doing Y. For example, Z.
* Suzuki (1999) suggested/argued/gave/claimed that X is Y. Also, it is Z
* This solution is not effective because X ("Title of Article," 1999, July 4). In addition, Y.
* When you [[Arrangement - write a detail sentence]], see [[Invention - quote and paraphrase]] and [[Style - use cohesion]]



### Response
Please [[Invention - quote and paraphrase]] properly and [[Style - use cohesion]] to clearly say if the solution is good or not:
* Disagree 	("However,..", "Nevertheless")
* Agree 		("Indeed,...", "In fact....")
* See [[Style - use cohesion]] for alternatives to "However" and "In fact"

* See [[Invention - quote and paraphrase]]


# Common Mistakes
### Use the correct tense/conditional
* X was attempted
* X has been attempted
* X is being attempted
* X will be attempted

Remember to [[Invention - quote and paraphrase]] properly

# Argument Essay Response Quiz
* Above, we focused on Summary-Response for Solutions.
* However, it can also be used for other reasons.
* Here is a summary-response quiz for misunderstandings about problems from Oxfam's "Explore overseas aid" http://www.oxfam.org.uk/education/resources/explore-overseas-aid

### For each RESPONSE, identify what summary it is responding to
The ambition for the aid budget is 0.7% of government spending – which is less than a penny in every pound the government spends. To pay for one junior nurse in the UK (21k) you would have to take away healthcare from 50,000 people in Malawi (Government of Malawi Ministry of Health, n.d.)QQQ2QQQMost of the international aid money is wasted because of corruption QQQIncreases in the international aid budget mean significant cuts to Government spending in the UK. QQQAid makes countries dependent, and stops economic growth.QQQGiving aid helps Britain’s reputation overseas.


After the 2nd world war the USA gave aid money to many Western European countries to rebuild their economies, through the Marshall Plan. These countries including the U.K, France and Germany are independent and wealthy countries today, and are not dependent on Aid money to provide public services. QQQ3QQQMost of the international aid money is wasted because of corruption QQQIncreases in the international aid budget mean significant cuts to Government spending in the UK. QQQAid makes countries dependent, and stops economic growth.QQQGiving aid helps Britain’s reputation overseas.


"It is simply not true that aid is largely misused. Bad news makes headlines, so we are far more likely to hear about the incidences of corruption, than the difference aid makes to the lives of millions of individuals every day.Calling for cuts in life-saving aid because some of it is misused is irresponsible. You wouldn’t suggest abandoning democracy because of a rigged election – you’d work to improve the democratic process." What summary of a criticism is this a response to? QQQ1QQQMost of the international aid money is wasted because of corruption QQQIncreases in the international aid budget mean significant cuts to Government spending in the UK. QQQAid makes countries dependent, and stops economic growth.QQQGiving aid helps Britain’s reputation overseas.



As well as helping people living in poverty, aid boosts Britain’s reputation abroad and, by helping to make the world a fairer place, reduces the risk of armed conflict.QQQ4QQQMost of the international aid money is wasted because of corruption QQQIncreases in the international aid budget mean significant cuts to Government spending in the UK.
