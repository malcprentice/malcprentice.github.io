Why is are these in-text citations bad? One mistake each, and the answer is not “short sentence” - APA problems!

# Answers
1) No title case in website pages
2) "January 16, 2019, from" - from is missing
3) If you have date in brackets (2017, April 6), you DO NOT need date of download "Retrieved 2019, June 11 from", just "Retrieved from"
4) Wilson reference is news, and should have "Reuters." in italics after title. Title itself should not be italics.
5) Neko ga suki reference is missing translation in square brackets "[I like cats]"
6) Mikiko is a first name. Always use surnames.
7) Mikiko references isn't Burasage
8) Whole list issue: not alphabetical order. Should be Application-Mikiko-Neko-Wilson.
