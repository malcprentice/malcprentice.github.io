# Aim
This activity helps you practice:
* understanding coding tasks in English
* solving problems
* describing problems to others
* searching for solutions on the internet in English (e.g. at Stack Exchange: http://stackexchange.com/)
* asking for help
* giving advice
* understanding advice given by others

### What will we do?
We will use one coding website to solve some easy problems in English. Why?
* For Information Systems: Competitive coding is becoming more popular as a part of the hiring process for Engineers.
* For Biology/Environment stream: You will be handling messy data sets - you can "mung" these more easily with a language like Python
* For Chemistry stream: It's fun!
 



### Instructions
1) Sign up for an HackerRank account: https://www.hackerrank.com
2) Choose your "domain"
* Beginner: Click Java/Python and learn the basics
* Info Sys: Choose Algorithms and try to use what you already know about C
* Advanced: Click "Competition" and try the Euler problems
3) Choose and solve some problems.
4) If you can't do it
* Google the topic ("How to use a C++ dictionary")
* Ask a friend
* Read the discussions
5) Choose one interesting problem. How did it go? Make a sentence for your log
* I could solve this problem, but the solution in the discussion was better because...
* I could solve this problem, but I learned something new to do it, which was...
* I could solve this problem. I realised....
* I could solve this problem. I ...
* I couldn't solve this problem, because I couldn't understand the question. I'm going to ...
* I couldn't solve this problem. The error kept saying "" and I couldn't find the answer. I'm going to ...


### How to submit
* Be ready to show it in class
** Screenshot or print the problem
** Screenshot or print your solution
* In class
** describe your problem
** describe what you did
** share your reflection on the problem
* Log
** At the bottom of the log, same as book/news/TED logs
** Give he name of the problem
** Give your "How did it go?" sentence from above.
