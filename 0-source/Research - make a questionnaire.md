# Sample size
If you want to generalise from the people you ask (sample) to the whole department/university, you need a large enough sample. 
Work it out here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-size-calculator/
However, it's tricky - about 250 people are needed to properly talk about a 1000 person department (with 95% confidence that your result is not an accident, and is within 5% of real answer)  
However, for practice research projects (i.e. unless you're actually doing your rombun), just state in your Discussion "Weaknesses" section that low sample size was a problem. 

# Write your questions
*Here is a website which has a lot of translated questionnaires with example question phrasing you can copy: http://whatjapanthinks.com 
*Use Google Drive forms. 
**Try out all the question types before you start designing your quesionnaire. 
**Try out "section based on resposne"
**Try out response validation
**Be careful with required answers.
