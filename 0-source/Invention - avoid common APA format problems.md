# Which verb should I use?
Bored of "said", "found" and "noted"? Choose another!

### MOST OF THE TIME, something is finished. Use past tense
	As Smith (1999) noted, X is Y				(Smith finished writing)
	Smith (1999) interviewed 10 JHS students		(Smith finished interviewing)

### If it is a FACT that is ALWAYS/STILL TRUE, use present tense

### To emphasize it is STILL IMPORTANT, use present perfect
	As Smith (1999) has noted, X is Y

### If something is NOT FINISHED, use present perfect
	All research so far has found that X is Y
	Data collected in this pilot project has shown X. Next, Y

# How do volume (issue) numbers work?
* Often one volume = one year
** Journal of Writing, 3(2)  	= 	"second issue in the third book"
* If each issue starts on page 1, 			there are several "page 23"s in one volume
** please give the issue number so I can find the correct page
* If each issue continues from the previous, 	there is only one "page 23" in each volume
** do not give the issue number
* Use italics for the thing you hold (see "Common Problem 8 below)
** You hold the Journal volume, not the issue
** YES	<em>Journal of Writing, 3</em><blue>(2)</blue>, 23-32
** NO	<em>Journal of Writing, 3<red>(2)</red></em>, 23-32



# WHat if my web page disappears?
This is why you put the "retrieved" date on website references.
Imagine you wanted to cite the front page of this website: http://www.qub.ac.uk/
However, the web page is down, or gone, or changed (which happens a lot with the front page of websites). If you give the date, then

1) Waybackmachine has an archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20160602044625/http://www.qub.ac.uk/
2)  Google Cache also has a version: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YG-g-gATZgsJ:www.qub.ac.uk/+ &cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=jp

That way people can use the cache or the wayback machine to access it.




# I can't find the answer here
There's a lot I don't know how to do. If this answer isn't above, do this:
* Search Google (e.g. "How to cite software in APA"). I usually find answers in one of these places:
** Purdue Online: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/
** NMU: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/
** APA styel blog: http://blog.apastyle.org
* Copy from another article that uses the same or similar source.
* Check the actual APA manual
** I have one
** The library has several
