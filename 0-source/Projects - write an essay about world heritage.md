#Overview
Do you know how world heritage sites are chosen? http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/
Do you think world heritage sites are a good idea? http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cumbria-25682571

World Heritage sites in Japan are often cared for very carefully, but this is not always the case:
*Edinburgh: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-15353402
*Istanbul: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11095638
*Liverpool: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-18592334
*Syria: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29255315

In this essay, lets look at some sites that are in danger. 

#Step 1: Choose a World Heritage site
*List of sites in danger: https://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/
*Choose something INTERESTING we DO NOT KNOW that is IN DANGER in ANOTHER COUNTRY (i.e. NOT Kyoto)
*Post it to Line. First come first served.
*Do NOT choose anything that is an example on this site
*Choose something with multiple problems (e.g. too many tourists AND overdevelopemtn AND pollution)
*Choose something with multiple solutions 
**(seperate, or three organisations
**prefereably at different levels e.g. International, national, and local NGOs)

#Step 2: Research your site
Read 3 articles about your site. 
Follow the requirements in your syllabus homework for number and type of reference. 
English or Japanese OK
Wikipedia OK, but it DOES NOT COUNT for your 3 articles, and you CANNOT cite it. 
<red>Don't forget to take a note of the references!</red>
Decide if it is a good essay if not. If not, choose another site and start again. 

#Step 3: Read the Template and Examples if they apply
This essay COULD follow the same pattern as endangered animals, so look at:
*[[Examples - example endangered animals essay]]
*If we are doing powerpoint first, check that template
*Standard planning outline
*Standard formatting template

#Step 4: Plan your own essay
I recommend:
+Introduction
+Description
+Three problems threatening the site
+Three solutions to those problems
+Conclusion

This is very similar to "endangered animals", and can use the same templates, examples, and language

#Step 5: Research more. 
Stuck? Here are some ideas:

##Common description points
I recommend you :
*DEFINITELY Define the site type ("Angkor Wat is a Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia, the largest in the world")
*MAYBE Partition the site into areas ("There are two main areas in Angkor Wat - outer and inner - of which...")
*MAYBE a Compare-contrast ("Angkor Wat is similar to Kinkakuji in that....however...")
*DEFINITELY a historical Time order ("Angkor Wat was built in the 12th century by...becuase.... After that... then... However...")
*A couple of other interesting details, one a number
**A random detail
**A number showing the size of the problem (things lost, area destroyed, tourist numbers, etc)
*Link (for essay)

##Common problems
*pollution
*tourists
**garbage
**graffiti
**vandalism
**erosion by feet
*theft 
**for local construction
**for souvenirs
*disrepair 
*disagreement over ownership
*destructive/intrusive/reckless development (roads, dams, hotels)
*Natural 
**Natural disasters (e.g. earthquake)
**climate change
**erosion (destruction by normal rain and wind)
**invasive species
**air pollution
**acide rain
*something that indirectly makes things worse
**lack of management
**Unemployment/Poverty (e.g. which makes people turn to looting/selling pieces/using it for building materials)
**Political Instability
**Corruption
*conflict (i.e. civil war) 
**stopping assistance reaching the area
**allows looting
**direct bombing damage


##Common solutions
Think about BOTH prevention, and restoration
*Organisations
**NGOs
**World Bank
**International groups e.g. UNESCO
**Local organisations
**National culture organisations 
**governments (National or International)
*Changes to tourism
**Tourism rules
**restricting the number of tourists
*transferring things to museums
*Repairing
*Restorating
*Preventative maintenance/systems
*Creating a management organisation
*Solving related problems 
**(poverty
**involving local people and educating them
**stopping conflict
**stopping corruption
*Resonsible/Sustainable Development
**rules for appropriate building styles/materials 
*Building necessary infrastructure
**too many tourists = need new sewage system or garbage incineration
**too many tourists driving = pollution = need new train
**too many toursists drinking = need new water supply



#Style tips - common mistakes
A common mistake is to say "This essay describes a world heritage."
World heritage is an IDEA, like "history", not a place.
When talking about the IDEA, "world heritage" on its own is OK
**World heritage is important.
**This organisation focuses on world heritage. 
HOWEVER, when talking about a specific place, you should say "World heritage + NOUN" 
**World heritage site
**world heritage area
**world heritage organisation
