# Overview
* Before reading this page, read this: [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]
* If you need to use someone else's words, there are two options: Quote or Paraphrase.
 
# Option 1: Quote
* "Quote" = Use the writer’s EXACT words in quotemarks ("")
** After this, he <blue>"</blue>renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton<blue>"</blue> (Nobel Foundation, 1922)
** Only do this for a FEW important quotes.
** Usually, you should paraphrase. ALWAYS give a page number if you can

You can make SMALL changes to quotes if they don't change the meaning:
Original			| "He doesn’t like cats, and although they are friendly he doesn’t like dogs either"
Shorter				| "He doesn’t like cats ... he doesn’t like dogs either"
Fix grammar			| "He doesn't like cats ... [or] dogs"
Fix pronouns		| "[Bob] doesn't like cats, ... [or] dogs"

# Option 2: Paraphrase
* Paraphrase - use your own words and grammar
** Change the words.
** CHange the word order
** Fix the grammar for your new version

* The best way to paraphrase is to 
** take notes in Japanese (only keywords in English) 
** then write in English without looking at original
* The worst way to paraphrase is to:
** copy paste a chunk
** Change the words e.g.  using a thesaurus:http://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/
** Change the word order
** Why? Because if you do it this way you will probably
*** Break the grammar
*** Use the wrong synonym ("same meaning word")
*** Forget and accidentally plagiarize
*** Fail to learn anything


Sometimes you need to change tense if you remove quotes
* "Imagination <blue>is</blue> more important than knowledge" (Einstein, 1931, p. 31)
* Einstein (1931) said that imagination <blue>was</blue> more important than knowledge


# Example paraphrases - why are these bad/good?
## Original
>><blue>He renounced his citizenship</blue> <green>for political reasons</green> and <purple>emigrated to America</purple> to <pink>take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton</pink> (Nobel Foundation, 1922).
## Bad paraphrase 1 - word/idea _order_ different, words not changed
>><green>For political reasons</green>, he <blue>renounced his citizenship</blue> and <pink> took the position of Theoretical Physics Professor at Princeton</pink> after he <purple>emigrated to America</purple> (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

## Bad paraphrase 2 - words changed but order the same
>>Einstein <blue>gave up his nationality</blue> for political <green>motives</green> and <purple>moved to the US</purple> to <pink>occupy the post of Lecturer on</pink> Theoretical Physics in Princeton (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

## Bad paraphrase 3 - meaning has been changed
>><red>Einstein hated politicians, so he settled in the Americas and became a Prince</red> (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

## Good paraphrase - words/idea order/grammar changed
>>On political grounds, Einstein gave up his citizenship, and having settled in the US became a Professor at Princeton University, teaching Theoretical Physics (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

## Good summary (paraphrase and shorten). Main ideas only
__Most of your paraphrases will probably be summaries.__
Einstein went to work at Princeton, having first given up his citizenship (Nobel Foundation, 1922).
