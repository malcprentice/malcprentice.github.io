In [[Study Skills - manage time]] you learned to make a plan.
However, if you look at your plan and want to do nothing, try one of these tricks.

# Trick 1: Set a Timer
*Set a timer for 10/20/30 minutes
*Study for at least that long

# Trick 2: Starting is hardest. So just start.
*Just take the first step
**Open Word and write the title.
**Pack a bag and go to the Gym or the Library
*Promise yourself that you can stop there if you want
*However, once you started, it's easier to continue

# Trick 3: Don't Break the Chain.

1) Get a Calendar
*A big paper calendar that goes in front of your desk
*An App for tracking several things. My favourite is Chains https://chains.cc/
2) Cross off every day you study
3) Do not break your streak! Link in Japanese: http://www.lifehacker.jp/2012/02/120216daytodayworkspace.html

# Trick 4: Compete
*Compete with yourself
**Track your important scores (QW word count, time to run 5km, study time)
**There are apps for exercise: steps walked (FitBit), cycling distance (Strava)
**Keep a chart. There are lots of apps for this, but paper is sometimes easier.
**Every week, try to beat yourself (less TV, faster 5km, more words)
*Also compete with others!
**Every week, try to beat your friends

# Trick 5: Form a Study Group
*If someone is waiting for you, you have to go study.
*If you don't understand, someone else does
*Combine it with tracking (Trick 4)
**Compete with your friends! Who can study the most?
**Compete with other groups! Which _group_ can study the most?
*If you can't meet in person, try an app.
**FOr vocab, for example, try Memrise: https://www.memrise.com/

# Trick 6: Reduce Distractions
*Turn off notifications from Line, etc.
*Go to the coffee shop or the library.
*Delete SMS you don't use much
*Hide your Playstation controllers
*Unsubscribed from streaming video service
*Use a browser plugin (NoScript) to break distracting websites

Don't go too far with this - you need to relax occasionally.
Just make it more difficult to get distracted


# Trick 7: Speak to someone
*Speak to your seniors
*Speak to a more motivated friedn
*Visit Malc: [[Schedules - Malc's schedule]]

# Trick 8: Stay healthy!
Sometimes you feel unmotivated because of your physical condition
*Get some exercise 
*Cook a healthy meal
*Go to bed early
*Stand up and move around
*Have a coffee (if you're sleepy)
*Stop drinking coffee (if you're getting stressed)

# Trick 9: Other ideas from other students
*Take a bath
*Listen to some heavy music
*Reward yourself with sweets
*Have a nap.
