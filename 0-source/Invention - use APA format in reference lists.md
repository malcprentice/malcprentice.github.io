# What style are we using?
We use "APA" style in this class. Not everyone does. Other common styles are:
|APA                    | Psychology, Business, Education, Engineering
|MLA                    | Languages, Literature
|Chicago                | History, Economics, Politics
|Biology            | (CSE/CBE): http://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/DocCSE.html
|Chemistry          | ACS: xhttp://pubs.acs.org/books/references.shtml
|Engineering        | (ASCE): http://pubs.asce.org/authors/journal/
|Law                | (Bluebook): http://www.legalbluebook.com/
|Medicine           | (AMA): http://healthlinks.washington.edu/hsl/styleguides/ama.html

# There are TWO DIFFERENT PARTS to citation style
1) A short code with the name and date
* you use this in your paragraphs or in your report summary
* See [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]
* It is SHORT and points to a longer source in a Reference list at the end of your report/essay
* In some styles, it is just a number
2) Your References section is at the end of your  report/essay (this sheet)
* This gives FULL information on the source you use.
* See this page

# Basic rules
* The Reference list should be in <red>alphabetical order (ABC).</red>
* The reference list matches the references used.
    * Nothing in text that isn't in list.
    * Nothing in list that isn't in the text
* Be careful to [[Style - use title case]]
* Be careful with capitals
* Be careful witb commas and periods. 
* Be careful with spaces.

## "Kiyou" (紀要)
These bulletins of a Japanese university department: https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%B4%80%E8%A6%81
* Often slightly lower quality than fully peer-reviewed Journals (学術雑誌)
* However, there might be a difference betweeen 大学等論文誌 and 大学紀要
* Usually available via "CiNii": http://ci.nii.ac.jp/en
* Give university name, as there might be more than one journal with that name and it might not be easy to find online.

### YouTube
TED talks is an organisation that publishes a collection of lectures only. So please give their name in italics, as if they were a newspaper. __However__, YouTube is a bunch of different people posting a variety of things. This means it is morelike a library. Do not cite their name.

Read these, but <red>don't cite them! </red>
Follow the links to the original sources. Cite those!

I've moved everythin to [[Invention - use APA format in the text]] so I can tidy everything up and switch to APA7. Hopefully answers will be easier to find soon! For now, if the page is confusing, just do what I do: google it. For example "How do I cite a website with no author in APA7".
