* Sometimes  traditions are changed or updated. Examples include Black Piet, Guy Fawkes (Google if youâ€™re interested). Think about traditions in your country. Which traditions (school, festival, food and drink, clothing, etc) do you think should change?
* Are you ready for an earthquake, a flood, etc? Do you have a prepared bag, or supplies?
* If  your PC/phone suddenly broke, would you have a recent backup or would you lose work/photos 
* Are you careful about computer security e.g. updates, antivirus, encryption (Bitlocker/Filevault), two factor authentication, password management.
