**See the "Examples" folder for "Example ALC screenshot.jpg" **If your time needed is too short or your score is suspiciously low, you get no point. For example, a half size test is usually 35-45 minutes. If you are a D level student (TOEIC 490+) and you did it in 20 minutes with a score of 35%, you weren't trying. No point. Decisions on this will be made depending on the class. Take your time and do the test properly.
