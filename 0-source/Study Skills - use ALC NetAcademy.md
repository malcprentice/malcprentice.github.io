# Rules for using ALC for Participation points
* See [[Study Skills - make a participation plan]]
* Screenshot must include:
    * Date from THIS TERM. 
    * Your NAME at the top
    * Appropriate "Time Needed" (e.g. フルサイズ in 45 minutes = not trying)
    * Appropriate score. Scores around 25% show you are GUESSING not trying. In C and D level classes or GCP, your real TOEIC scores are over 395. So ALC scores <30% = not trying = no point). This is not a requirement for B or lower level classes. 
* Can't find your score? 
    * 1) Find the menu bar "全体 / All 学習 / Units テスト / Tests"
    * 2) Choose "Tests"
    * 3) Click the Green clock under "履歴 / Learning Records". It should show:
    * Screenshot that page, and paste it into your Participation Plan.
