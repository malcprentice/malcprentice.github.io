# Rules for for ALC points in Malc's class
* You usually only get a "Try it out" point for doing a test.
* *One point. For any test. So "ハーフサイズ" might be faster
* * <red> If we are online after May 11, this might change - check the plan page again</red>: [[Study Skills - make a participation plan]]
* To get points, the end of term:
** Select your course
** find "全体 / All 学習 / Units テスト / Tests"
** Choose "Tests"
** Click the Green clock under "履歴 / Learning Records". It should show:
*** a) your name 
*** b) every test you took with 
*** c) "time needed" 
** EITHER show me your phone screen at the end of term along with other participation sheets (EF, WC, GV, extra QW)
** OR email it to me at the end of term.
