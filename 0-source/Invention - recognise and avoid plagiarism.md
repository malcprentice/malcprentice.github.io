# Definition and warning
*Plagiarism = Stealing someone's words or ideas 
*Students usually do it because it's 3am, the essay is due at 9am, and they copy paste from the internet without thinking. 
*If you copy-paste, I will see it, Google it, and find it. It's easy to spot.
*If I see it on your final draft) I will fail you! 
*If you make it a habit, it can have serious consequences, especially after first year or during study abroad: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/19/the-shameful-final-chapter-for-japans-most-promising-stem-cell-scientist/


# Types of plagiarism 
There are many kinds of plagiarism. Imagine, for example, that you read a sentence in an article about Einstein and want to use it in your essay.

### Original sentence:
"He renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton" (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Type 1 Plagiarism: Copy-paste with no citation and no quotes
The next year, Einstein <red>renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America, </red> where he worked at Princeton.

### Type 2 Plagiarism: Copy-paste with quotes but no citation
The next year Einstein <red>"renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America"</red> where he worked at Princeton.

### Type 3 Plagiarism: Copy-paste with citation but no quotes
The next year he renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America (Nobel Foundation, 1922) where he worked at Princeton.

### Type 4 Plagiarism: Copy-paste and just change a few words
He <orange>gave up</orange> his citizenship for  <orange>some </orange> reasons and emigrated to  <orange>the US </orange> to take the position of  <orange>teacher </orange> of Theoretical Physics at Princeton" (Nobel Foundation, 1922).



### Type 5 Plagiarism: Perfectly cited, but too many quotes ("Patchwriting")
>Deforestation is also a major source of greenhouse gases. <red>"Approximately a third of all human related greenhouse gas emissions are absorbed by the oceans"</red> (SEE Turtles, n.d.). Last, <red>"WWF works around  the world to establish marine protected areas (MPA) to ensure sea turtles have a safe place to nest, feed and migrate freely"</red> (WWF, n.d.), and there is a treaty about the international business of the endangered wild animals and plants. However, <red>"despite their current protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and many national laws, there is still a disturbingly large amount of illegal trade in hawksbill shells and products"<red> (WWF, n.d.).


# What is the solution?
See [[Invention - quote and paraphrase]] for detail. In short:
1) take notes in Japanese, or using only keywords in English
2) write in English sentences in your own words.
3) Don't just copy-paste English sentences then change a few words!
5) Only quote for a reason. Quote ONLY a FEW SHORT and IMPORTANT phrases.
6) Cite once every idea/sentence, not once per paragraph_
7) Run it through Grammarly: https://www.grammarly.com/plagiarism-checker
*You would need to pay to get details, 
*but if it says "Significant plagiarism detected", read your essay and look for copy-pasted chunks.
