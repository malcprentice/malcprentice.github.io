#Discussion
###We buy/use a lot of different products every day
*food every day
*clothes every month
*phone every few years

###However, producing them often has a bad impact on:
**the people/places where they are collected
**the people/places where they are produced
**the people/places where they are recycled

###Ask your partner these questions.
How often is the answer "I don't know"?
*Were your clothes made by children?
*Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken? https://www.google.co.jp/search?q=free+range+chicken&newwindow=1&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjn_9yU4JzMAhVhxqYKHfcVBPAQ_AUIBygB&biw=1366&bih=669
*Was your phone made in a safe factory?
*Were your cosmetics tested on animals?
*Is there palm oil in your toothpaste?
*Will your phone be recycled properly?: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/

**"TEMPLATE for ESSAY.docx"
**"TEMPLATE for ESSAY OUTLINE.docx"
*Read the example essay [[Examples - example ethical consumption essay]]

##2) Choose something you buy regularly
*Choose something you buy/eat/use __at least once a month.__
*Choose something that comes from overseas, probably a third world country
*Choose a __simple__ thing.
**palm oil, not toothpaste
**tantalum, not iPhones

*Choose something that:
**causes at least three problems
**has at least three solutions
*Stuck for ideas? Make some lists!
**Think about Things you use directly e.g. plastic bags
**Think about things you use indirectly e.g. tungsten in light bulbs
**Think about things in your home


##3) Research your topic
###Focus on good sources
*newspaper articles
*government reports
*NGO websites

###You will present your research over the next two weeks
*Do the first research in Japanese
**take rough handwritten notes
**take notes in English
**Do not copy paste
**Write keywords, not sentences
*Later
**we will do more research in English
**we will type up pour notes in English (Essay Outline Template)


###Research area 1: What is your product?
*Where does it come from?
*Who makes it?
*What is it used for?
*How is it made?
*How is it similar or different to something we know better?

###Research 2: When researching problems (Cause-Effect)
* __Think about the WHOLE LIFE of the product__
**Preparations (e.g. deforestation by fire)
**Collection (e.g. mining pollution, slave labour)
**Production (e.g. suicide by workers in China, factory collapse in Bangladesh)
**Recycling e.g. http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/world/asia/china-electronic-waste-e-waste/
* __Think about the effect on people__
**People producing/collecting/assembling/recycling the thing
**People displaced from the land used
**People living near the place it is made/recycled
* __Think about the effect on the environment__
**animals
**plants
**soil
**air
**water
* <red>Avoid this common mistake</red>:
**The focus of this article is problems that __you__ cause for __other__ people/places/things
**Problems caused _for you_ are NOT the topic. 
**If something you buy causes you problems, you can just stop buying it.
**The people who make things can't stop making them, though. 

###Research 3: When researching solutions (Summary-Response)
*Labelling
**labelling laws (contents, source of materials, location of production)
**labelling groups e.g. Bluesign ( clothing) HSSE ( Jewelry), Dolphin safe (Tuna), Fairtrade (Various), etc
**Farming methods labels (e.g. free range chicken/eggs)
*Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, or avoid completely
**Use less of something
**Use it again for something else.
**Use re-usable instead of disposable things (e.g. EcoBags)
**Avoid it (go vegetarian, keep using your old phone)
**Recycling things you use (e.g. batteries, PET, cans)
**Buying recycled things (e.g. recycled paper)
*Part of purchase goes to charity__
**e.g. http://www.red.org/en/
**e.g. Toms shoes http://www.toms.com/stories/giving/giving-partner-interview-with-coprodeli-in-peru
*Making laws
**International (UN) law
**National (e.g. Japan) law
**Companies voluntary codes
*Activism
**Campaign/Awareness solutions (letter writing).
**Boycott / Protest

###Focus on what you know
Your major can help you research. Focus on what you know:
*e.g. technological topics/solutions (Engineering)
*e.g. trade agreement Solutions (Business)
*e.g. legal solutions (Law)

###When researching why solutions don't work (RESPONSE)
*Corruption
*There is a law, but police don't/can't enforce it (e.g. trade in animal parts)
*Solution causes new problems, worse that old: http://www.forbes.com/sites/amywestervelt/2012/04/25/can-recycling-be-bad-for-the-environment/
*The solution works, but is not widespread or effective (e.g. what percentage of coffee is Fairtrade now?)
