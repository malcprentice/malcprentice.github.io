# Aim 
We will write an essay about ethical consumption (倫理的消費) and learn why we need to think carefully about people and the environment before we buy things.

By the end of this project you will be able to:
* Know more about how the things you buy change the world
* Write an academic essay in English 
** Research it and take notes
** Arrange your research well
** Write sentences in academic English style
** Format (フォーマット) it well
** Cite your sources (出典を引用します) in "APA style" (アメリカ心理学会論文作成)

# Essay Project Unit 1 - Introduction 
* You __do not have to submit anything__ for Unit 1. 
* Just think, read, listen and __take notes__
* Email me if you have questions.

### 1A: Think and Understand
* We buy/use a lot of different products every day
** food every day
** clothes every month
** electronics (e.g. phone) every few years
* However, this can be bad for:
** the people/places where they are collected
** the people/places where they are produced
** the people/places where they are recycled
* For example, how often is the answer "I don't know"?
** Were your clothes made by children? https://www.unicef.org/csr/garments.html
** Was your phone made in a safe factory? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides
** Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken? https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=free++range++chicken&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
** Were your cosmetics tested on animals?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_cosmetics_on_animals
** Is there palm oil in your toothpaste? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil
** Will your phone be recycled properly?: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/

### 1B:  Watch this 11 min video
Take notes. 
It's difficult, so if you don't understand:
* Turn on English subtitles (字幕)
* If you still don't understand, turn on Japanese subtitles 
* If you used Japanese, watch it AGAIN with English

### 1C: Read the example essay 
* Read this: [[Examples - example ethical consumption essay]]
* We will write an essay like this 
* Don't worry! 
** The essay was written by a student. You can do this too!
** We will do it __slowly,__ step by step over WEEKS. No rush!

### Optional: Watch this TED Talk, it has the same Arrangement as this essay

# Essay Project Unit 2 
* Just do a little research
* Enough to decide - is your topic good or not?

### 1) Make a list of products  
* things you used this week
* things you buy regularly
* things you have at home
* things you want to buy
* things you use __at least once a month.__
* things from overseas 
* things you buy things in (packaging)

### 2) Make a list of things INSIDE the things on your list
* Inside your product are many materials(材料)
* Usually, these are worse than finished products. 
* e.g. palm oil in toothpaste
* e.g. tantalum in iPhones
* e.g. wood pulp in notebooks
* e.g. cotton in t-shirts
* e.g. shrimp in onigiri

### 3) Choose a good essay topic from your list
Choose something SIMPLE or a material (材料)
Do not choose:
* any endangered animal products (that's essay 2)
** e.g. no endangered tuna species
** e.g. no elephant ivory
* any products I used as an example
** not palm oil (the example essay)
** not tantalum (the video)

### 5) Research your topic A LITTLE
For now, research __a little__ to check it is a good topic:
* Google your topic
* Research in Japanese/your language is OK. 
* Read ANYTHING, even bad sources like Wikipedia
* Notes in Japanese/your language are OK. 

Ask yourself: 
* Does buying it cause __three__ problems?
** e.g. pollution, child labour, conflict
** e.g. poverty, dangerous working conditions
* Please focus on problems
** for the people who MAKE IT 
** for the people who live where it is made
** for the environment 
** when it is recycled or thrown away
* Please DO NOT focus on problems for people who buy it
** Our problems are not the point. 
** We can just stop buying it!
** e.g. "tobacco farms use child labour", not "tobacco gives people cancer" 
** e.g. "meat production causes global warming", not "eating hamburgers makes me fat"  

* Does it have  __three__ solutions
** e.g. NGO, NPO, making laws
** e.g. reduce, reuse, recycle
** e.g. stop buying, buy something else, 

### Homework by next class: 
Email Malc your idea to check 
You should be able to write:
* "I chose TOPIC"
* "TOPIC is ... It ..."
* "There are three main problems - 1, 2, and 3"
* "There are three main solutions - 1, 2, and 3."

For example
> " __I chose__ Tantalum. Tantalum __is__ a kind of metal used in electronic devices. It comes from Central Adrica. __There three main problems -__ child soldiers, dangerous mines, and pollution. __There are three main solutions__ - fair trade phones, recycling, and UNICEF's work in the Congo"

### Suggestions for researching "What is your topic?" (paragraph D)

* How many kinds are there ("Partition")
* Is it the same as something we know ("Comparison")
* How is it made?  ("Time Order")
* What is it's history? ("Time Order")

** When was it discovered?

### Suggestions for researching "Problems" (paragraph P)
** Preparation (e.g. deforestation by fire)
** Collection (e.g. mining pollution, slave labour)

### Suggestions for researching SOLUTIONS (paragraph S part 1)
* Things NGOs, governments can do

Remember - solutions do not need to be specific

** ...then solutions CAN be specific (pollution, water, and working conditions)
** ...but solutions can ALSO be general (Fair Trade, recycle)
* If refugee problems are food, health, and security...
** ...then solutions CAN be specific (food, health, and security)
** ...but solutions can ALSO be general (repatriation, resettlement, changing asylum policy)

### Suggestions for researching RESPONSES (paragraph S part 2)
* Are your solutions working well? How do you know? Try to give a number
** "cases of X decreased by 60% in 2018"
** "number of X increased from 40% to 75% in 2019"
** "250,000 students have received X since 2015"
** "232 X  built so far"
* Are your solutions not working well? How do you know?
** "However, this solution is only partly effective, because..."
** They only work in one country
** They only work 20% of people
** They haven't been working very long
** There are problems with corruption
** They don't have enough money to continue or expand
