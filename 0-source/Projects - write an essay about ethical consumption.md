# Aim 
We will write an essay about ethical consumption (倫理的消費) and learn why we need to think carefully about people and the environment before we buy things.

By the end of this project you will be able to:
* Know more about how the things you buy change the world
* Write an academic essay in English 
    * Research it and take notes
    * Arrange your research well
    * Write sentences in academic English style
    * Format (フォーマット) it well
    * Cite your sources (出典を引用します) in "APA style" (アメリカ心理学会論文作成)

# Essay Project Unit 1 - Introduction 
* You __do not have to submit anything__ for Unit 1. 
* Just think, read, listen and __take notes__
* Email me if you have questions.

### 1A: Think and Understand
* We buy/use a lot of different products every day
    * food every day
    * clothes every month
    * electronics (e.g. phone) every few years
* However, this can be bad for:
    * the people/places where they are collected
    * the people/places where they are produced
    * the people/places where they are recycled
* For example, how often is the answer "I don't know"?
    * Were your clothes made by children? https://www.unicef.org/csr/garments.html
    * Was your phone made in a safe factory? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides
    * Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken? https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=free++range++chicken&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
    * Were your cosmetics tested on animals?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_cosmetics_on_animals
    * Is there palm oil in your toothpaste? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil
    * Will your phone be recycled properly?: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/

### 1B:  Watch this 11 min video
Take notes. 
It's difficult, so if you don't understand:
* Turn on English subtitles (字幕)
* If you still don't understand, turn on Japanese subtitles 
* If you used Japanese, watch it AGAIN with English

### 1C: Read the example essay 
* Read this: [[Examples - example ethical consumption essay]]
* We will write an essay like this 
* Don't worry! 
    * The essay was written by a student. You can do this too!
    * We will do it __slowly,__ step by step over WEEKS. No rush!

### Optional: Watch this TED Talk, it has the same Arrangement as this essay

# Essay Project Unit 2 
* In this unit you will 
    * Review homework
    * Learn how to do the homework - Choose your topic and do a little research. 

### 1) Make a list of products  
* things you used this week
* things you buy regularly
* things you have at home
* things you want to buy
* things you use __at least once a month.__
* things from overseas 
* things you buy things in (packaging)

### 2) Make a list of things INSIDE the things on your list
* Inside your product are many materials(材料)
* Usually, these are worse than finished products. 
* e.g. palm oil in toothpaste
* e.g. tantalum in iPhones
* e.g. wood pulp in notebooks
* e.g. cotton in t-shirts
* e.g. shrimp in onigiri

### 3) Choose a good essay topic from your list
Choose something SIMPLE or a material (材料)
Do not choose:
* any endangered animal products (that's essay 2)
    * e.g. no endangered tuna species
    * e.g. no elephant ivory
* any products I used as an example
    * not palm oil (the example essay)
    * not tantalum (the video)

### 4) Claim your topic 
* Check the group list on Classroom
* If you someone has already chosen your topic, choose a new topic
* If not, claim your topic by writing it on the list ("Hiroko - Cotton")


### Homework by next class: 
Research your topic __a little__ to check it is a good topic:
* Google your topic + "problem" or "solution" or the example keywords
* Read Japanese/English/anything OK
* Notes in English 
* Read bad sources if you want (Wikipedia, Quora, etc) but no notes!
* Complete the  <green>green</green>, and <red>red</red> parts of this 
    * You homework is only to  __find 6 keywords__ - 3 problems and 3 solutions
    * KEYWORD = NOUN or short noun phrase NOT sentences. 
    * If you can't find 6 keywords, __change your topic!__

### Example outline (step 2)
+ Problems
    + Problem 1: <green>KEYWORD</green>
    + Problem 2: <green>KEYWORD</green>
    + Problem 3: <green>KEYWORD</green>
+ Solutions
    + Solution 1: <red>KEYWORD</red>
    + Solution 2: <red>KEYWORD</red>
    + Solution 3: <red>KEYWORD</red> 

### Example keywords
* Problems 
    * (probably NOUNS)
    * child/slave labour, conflict, poverty, dangerous working conditions, deforestation, air/water/sea/soil pollution 
* Solutions 
    * (probably GROUP NAMES or ING verbs)
    * e.g. NGO name (UNICEF), NPO name (Fair Trade), making laws, reducing, reusing, recycling, buying X instead, campaigning

### IMPORTANT TIPS
* 1) Focus on problems and solutions for people who make it (workers, farmers) and the environment. NOT on people who buy it (they can just stop) or large companies. For example, "tobacco farms use child labour" rather than "tobacco gives you cancer" or "tobacco company profits will go down"
* 2) Solutions do not need to match problems exactly. For example, if your problem is "water pollution", you might not need a "clean water" solution. You could instead focus on recycling, poverty, global warming, trade laws - anything that stops the water in that area getting polluted in the first place.

 
# Essay Project Unit 3 
### Homework before class
You should be ready to tell the class
* "I chose TOPIC" _(+definition if others students don't know that word)_
* "There are three main problems - 1, 2, and 3"
* "There are three main solutions - 1, 2, and 3."

For example
> " __I chose__ Tantalum. _Tantalum is a metal used to make electronics like mobile phones._  __There three main problems -__ child soldiers, dangerous mines, and pollution. __There are three main solutions__ - fair trade phones, recycling, and UNICEF's work in the Congo"


### Homework after class
* Add more detail to <green>problems</green> and <red>solutions</red>
* Start using the online outline (Google Classroom)
    * Homework is to add more detail


### Homework
* Find the template assignment on Google Classroom
* Read the suggestions below (and read the example essay again if it is confusing)
* Read 6-8 more things - 3-4 English, 3-4 your language
* Take notes only in English
* Research three paragraphs: 
    * Description (What is your topic, how is it made)
    * Problems (more detail on your chosen problems)
    * Solutions (summmaries of your 3 chosen solutions + if they  work well or not)
    * Not necessary to research Introduction or Conclusion
* TYPE your new details into the red, blue, and green bits of the outline
    * Keywords and short phrases! 
    * Don't write sentences yet!
* You need enough detail that I know you can write the sentences from these notes without doing more research. Enough detail that I know, for example, if your responses are good or bad. 
* Deadline is next WRITING class, next week, not next class
* Use good sources
    * Take notes on newspapers, government report, NGO site
    * Don't use Dictionary,  Wikipedia, Question sites (e.g. About.com)
    * For more, read this: [[Invention - find good sources]]
* Do not plagiarise!
    * Do not copy-paste English notes!
    * Read, understand, and write your own notes
    * Advanced version: [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]
 
### Example outline (step 3)
You chose the __BOLD KEYWORDS__ already, last week. However, if you find something better, you can change them. Or even change your topic. Check with me first though.  



+ Introduction (Paragraph I)
    + GENERAL TOPIC (things we buy, e.g. mobile phone)
    + SPECIFIC TOPIC (one thing in a phone = Tantalum)
+ DESCRIPTION of topic (paragraph <blue>D</blue>)
    + Definition ("Kind of metal used in electronic devices")
    + Time order detail (how is it made?)
    + Other detail ("Comes from Central Africa")
    + Other detail

    * How often? 
    * How few?

    * "cases of X decreased by 60% in 2018"
    * "number of X increased from 40% to 75% in 2019"
    * "250,000 students have received X since 2015"
    * "232 X  built so far"
