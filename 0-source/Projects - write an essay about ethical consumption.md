# Discussion
### We buy/use a lot of different products every day
* food every day
* clothes every month
* phone every few years

### However, producing them often has a bad impact on:
** the people/places where they are collected
** the people/places where they are produced
** the people/places where they are recycled

### Ask your partner these questions.
How often is the answer "I don't know"?
* Were your clothes made by children?
* Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken? https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=free++range++chicken&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
* Was your phone made in a safe factory?
* Were your cosmetics tested on animals?
* Is there palm oil in your toothpaste?
* Will your phone be recycled properly?: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/

# Homework Week 1
## 1) Get ready
* Find "Template for Essay" on Google Classroom
** I will explain next time. 
** For now, just make sure you can find it.

## 2) Read the example essay 
Here: [[Examples - example ethical consumption essay]]

## 3) Make a list of products  
* things you used this week
* things you buy regularly
* things you have at home
* things you want to buy
* things you use __at least once a month.__
* things that comes from overseas, probably a third world country
* things you buy things in (packaging)


## 4) Make a list of substances IN the things on your list
Substances are usually worse than final products. The factory that makes earphones might not be a problem, but the metals from Africa used to make them probably are:
* e.g. tungsten in light bulbs
* e.g. cotton in your t-shirts
* e.g. shrimp in your onigiri


## 5) Choose a good topic from you list
Good essay topics are usually:
* things that are simple, usually substances 
* list from step 4 usually better than step 3
** e.g. palm oil, not toothpaste
** e.g. tantalum, not iPhones
** e.g. trees in Malaysia, not notebooks

Do not choose:
* things that are NOT endangered animals (that's essay 2!)
** e.g. no tuna
** e.g. no ivory
* something I used as an example
** do not choose palm oil (the example essay)
** do not choose tantalum (the video)
* complicated things with many parts and substances

## 6) Research your topic A LITTLE
Research enough to know if it's a good topic or not
Research in Japanese is OK. Notes in Japanese are OK. 
Make sure it will be easy to write about:
* cause at least three problems
* have at least three solutions

* You should be able to say:
** "I chose TOPIC"
** "TOPIC is a kind of... It is..."
** "It causes three problems - 1, 2, and 3"
** "I have maybe found 5 solutions so far. The best 3 are 1, 2, and 3."
* For example
** "I chose Tantalum"
** "Tantalum is a kind of metal. It is used in electronic devices. It comes from Ghana"
** "It causes three problems - it funds conflict, the mining is dangerous, and it causes pollution"
** "I have maybe found 5 solutions so far. The best 3 are all NGOs which are working in the DCR."


# Homework week 2 and 3: Research your topic more
## Research tips
### Focus on good sources
* newspaper articles
* government reports
* NGO websites

### You will present your research over the next two weeks
* Do the first research in Japanese
** take rough handwritten notes
** take notes in English
** Do not copy paste
** Write keywords, not sentences
* Later
** we will do more research in English
** we will type up our notes in English (Essay Outline Template)


### Focus on what you know
Your major can help you research. Focus on what you know:
* e.g. technological topics/solutions (Engineering)
* e.g. trade agreement Solutions (Business)
* e.g. legal solutions (Law)

### When researching why solutions don't work (RESPONSE)
* Corruption
* There is a law, but police don't/can't enforce it (e.g. trade in animal parts)
* Solution causes new problems, worse that old: http://www.forbes.com/sites/amywestervelt/2012/04/25/can-recycling-be-bad-for-the-environment/
* The solution works, but is not widespread or effective (e.g. what percentage of coffee is Fairtrade now?)

### <red>Avoid this common mistake</red>:
** The focus of this article is problems that __you__ cause for __other__ people/places/things
** Problems caused _for you_ are NOT the topic. 
** If something you buy causes you problems, you can just stop buying it.
** The people who make things can't stop making them, though. 




## 6) Research "What is your product?"
* Where does it come from?
* Who makes it?
* What is it used for?
* How is it made?
* How is it similar or different to something we know better?

## 7) Research Problems (Cause-Effect)
*  __Think about the WHOLE LIFE of the product__
** Preparations (e.g. deforestation by fire)
** Collection (e.g. mining pollution, slave labour)
** Production (e.g. suicide by workers, factory collapses)
** Recycling e.g. http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/world/asia/china-electronic-waste-e-waste/
*  __Think about the effect on people__
** People producing/collecting/assembling/recycling the thing
** People displaced from the land used
** People living near the place it is made/recycled
*  __Think about the effect on the environment__
** animals
** plants
** soil
** air
** water


## 8) Research Solutions (Summary-Response)
* Labelling
** labelling laws (contents, source of materials, location of production)
** labelling groups e.g. Bluesign ( clothing) HSSE ( Jewelry), Dolphin safe (Tuna), Fairtrade (Various), etc
** Farming methods labels (e.g. free range chicken/eggs)
* Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, or avoid completely
** Use less of something
** Use it again for something else.
** Use re-usable instead of disposable things (e.g. EcoBags)
** Avoid it (go vegetarian, keep using your old phone)
** Recycling things you use (e.g. batteries, PET, cans)
** Buying recycled things (e.g. recycled paper)
* Part of purchase goes to charity__
** e.g. http://www.red.org/en/
** e.g. Toms shoes http://www.toms.com/stories/giving/giving-partner-interview-with-coprodeli-in-peru
* Making laws
** International (UN) law
** National (e.g. Japan) law
** Companies voluntary codes
* Activism
** Campaign/Awareness solutions (letter writing).
** Boycott / Protest
