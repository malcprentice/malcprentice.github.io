# Contents
* This project will take WEEKS. 
* Follow your syllabus for Homework 1, 2, 3, etc
* Don't read ahead too far! I need to explain some things for each homework.

If you have problems understanding, translate this page, then ask

# Project Homework  1 - Introduction 
* You __do not have to submit anything__ for Homework 1. 
* Just think, read, listen and __take notes__
* Email me if you have questions. 

## Homework 1A: think and understand
### We buy/use a lot of different products every day
* food every day
* clothes every month
* electronics (e.g. phone) every few years

### However, this can be bad for:
* the people/places where they are collected
* the people/places where they are produced
* the people/places where they are recycled

### Think about these questions:
Click the links _only if you do not understand the question_
* You don't need to read the article - just enough to understand 
* They are difficult, so translation is OK

How often is the answer "I don't know"?
* Were your clothes made by children? https://www.unicef.org/csr/garments.html
* Was your phone made in a safe factory? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides
* Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken? https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=free++range++chicken&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
* Were your cosmetics tested on animals?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_cosmetics_on_animals
* Is there palm oil in your toothpaste? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil
* Will your phone be recycled properly?: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/



## Homework 1B:  Watch this 11 min video
Take notes. 
It's difficult, so if you don't understand:

## Homework 1C: Read the example essay 
* Read this: [[Examples - example ethical consumption essay]]
* We will write an essay like this 
* Don't worry! 
** The essay was written by a student. You can do this too!
** We will do it __slowly,__ step by step over WEEKS. No rush!

# Project Homework 2 - choose a topic 
* Just do a little research
* Enough to decide - is your topic good or not?

### 1) Make a list of products  
* things you used this week
* things you buy regularly
* things you have at home
* things you want to buy
* things you use __at least once a month.__
* things that comes from overseas, probably a third world country
* things you buy things in (packaging)

### 2) Make a list of things INSIDE the things on your list
* Inside your product are many materials(材料)
* Usually, these are worse than finished products. 
* e.g. palm oil in toothpaste
* e.g. tantalum in iPhones
* e.g. wood pulp in notebooks
* e.g. cotton in t-shirts
* e.g. shrimp in onigiri

### 3) Choose a good essay topic from your list
Choose something SIMPLE or a material (材料)
Do not choose:
* any endangered animal products (that's essay 2)
** e.g. no endangered tuna species
** e.g. no elephant ivory
* any products I used as an example
** not palm oil (the example essay)
** not tantalum (the video)

### 5) Research your topic A LITTLE
You will research more later. 
Now, research __ just enough__ to check it is a good topic:
* Google your topic
* Research in Japanese/your language is OK. 
* Read ANYTHING, even bad sources like Wikipedia
* Notes in Japanese/your language are OK. 

Ask yourself: 
* Does buying it cause __three__ problems for other people or environment 
** e.g. pollution, child labour, conflict
** e.g. poverty, dangerous working conditions

* Important: Problems for people who make, not people who buy
** You can just stop buying/eating it. Workers can't stop making/farming it
** "tobacco farms use child labour", not "tobacco gives people cancer" 
** "meat production causes global warming", not "eating hamburgers makes me fat"  

* Does it have  __three__ solutions
** e.g. NGO, NPO, making laws
** e.g. reduce, reuse, recycle
** e.g. stop buying, buy something else, 

### 6) Email Malc your idea to check
You should be able to write:
* "I chose TOPIC"
* "TOPIC is ... It ..."
* "There are at least three problems, for example 1, 2, and 3"
* "There are at least three solutions, for example 1, 2, and 3."

For example
> " __I chose__ Tantalum. Tantalum __is__ a kind of metal used in electronic devices. It comes from Central Adrica. __There are at least three solutions, for example__ child soldiers, dangerous mines, and pollution. __There are at least three solutions, for example__ fair trade phones, recycling, and UNICEF's work in the Congo"

# Project Homework 3 - Research your product and problems
Now you have chosen a good topic, read more and add details. 
Read at least three things, minimum. 
This time, focus on DESCRIPTION and PROBLEMS, not solutions
In class, we will learn how to [[Invention - find good sources]], but in summary:

* Choose good sources
** newspaper articles
** government reports
** NGO websites
* Avoid bad sources
** No Dictionaries
** No Wikipedia, no Wikis, no pedias, including Encyclopaedias.
** No "question answering" sites (Quora, Yahoo, About.com)

Also:
* Read at least 50% English sources
** Reading 50% in your language is OK, 
** But take 100% of your notes in English
* Notes should be short 
** Use keywords and short phrases
** Don't write sentences yet. 
* Do not plagiarise!
** Do not copy-paste English notes!
** Read, understand, and write your own notes
** A very detailed look is here: [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]


### Some ideas for researching "What is your product?"
* What kind of thing is it? ("Definition")
* What different kinds are there ("Partition")
* How is it similar/different to something we know better? ("Comparison")
* How is it made? ("Time Order")
* What else do you know? ("Details"). For example:
** Where does it come from?
** Who makes it?
** What is it used for?

### Some ideas for researching Problems 
* Think about the WHOLE LIFE of the product
** Preparations (e.g. deforestation by fire)
** Collection (e.g. mining pollution, slave labour)
** Production (e.g. suicide by workers, factory collapses)
** Recycling (e.g. pollution http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/world/asia/china-electronic-waste-e-waste/)
* Think about the effect on people
** People producing/collecting/assembling/recycling the thing
** People living near where it is made/recycled
* Think about the effect on the environment
** animals
** plants
** soil
** air
** water


# Project Homework 4 - Research your solutions and responses
Read three MORE things (total 6 minimum)
This time, focus on SOLUTIONS and RESPONSES
Solutions are usually:
* Things students can do
* Things NGOs, governments, etc, are doing
* Things companies are doing 
* Things people are doing NOW, not things in past or future


Solutions are not perfect. If they were, there would be no problems. 
* Also research RESPONSES 
* Are your solutions working well? How do you know?
* Are your solutions not working well? How do you know?

### Some ideas for researching SOLUTIONS
* Labelling laws (dolphin safe tuna)
* Fairtrade and similar programs
* Any NGO working on the problem
* Any NGO working on a related problem (poverty)
* Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, or avoid completely
* Part of purchase goes to charity e.g. http://www.red.org/en/
* Making laws
** International (UN) law
** National (e.g. Japan) law
** Companies voluntary codes
* Activism
** Campaign/Awareness solutions (letter writing).
** Boycott / Protest

### Some ideas for researching RESPONSES 
In your essay, you will write sentences like
* "However, this solution is only partly effective, because..."
* "In fact, this solution is working very welll - for example...

Research which one you will use for each solution! 
Many solutions are not perfect. For example:
* They only work in one country
* They only work 20%
* They haven't been working very long
* There are problems with corruption
* They don't have enough money to continue or expand

# Project Homework 5: Arrange your notes and plan your essay
### For homework 2 you made an outline like this
THen you gathered detail for it in homework 3 and 4
* TOPIC (Tantalum)
* DESCRIPTION of Tantalum (paragraph 1)
** Definition ("Kind of metal used in electronic devices")
** Detail ("Comes from Central Africa")
* Three PROBLEMS
** 1 (Child soldiers)
** 2 (Dangerous mines)
** 3 (Pollution)
* Three SOLUTIONS
** 1 (Fair Trade)
** 2 (Recycling)
** 3 (UNICEF's work)

### This week, we will put all of your notes together
We will make an essay plan outline
* I will share the essay outline template
* I will talk about Arrangement for essays
* I will explain more in class about 
** Arrangement - planning your essay
** Invention - using sources in academic essays

# Project Homework 6: Start writing
* Find "Template for Essay" on Google Classroom
* I will explain more in class about 
** Style - writing food sentences
** Presentation - formatting Templates. 
* DO NOT WRITE ALL FIVE PARAGRAPHS NOW. This is our first essay, we will do it slowly, step by step.
