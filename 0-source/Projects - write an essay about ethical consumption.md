#Aim 
We will write an essay about ethical consumption (倫理的消費) and learn why we need to think carefully about people and the environment before we buy things.

By the end of this project you will be able to:
* Know more about how the things you buy change the world
* Write an academic essay in English 
** Research it and take notes
** Arrange your research well
** Write sentences in academic English style
** Format (フォーマット) it well
** Cite your sources (出典を引用します) in "APA style" (アメリカ心理学会論文作成)

# Contents
* This project will take WEEKS. 
* Follow your syllabus for Homework 1, 2, 3, etc
* Don't read ahead too far! I need to explain some things for each homework.

# Project Homework  1 - Introduction 
* You __do not have to submit anything__ for Homework 1. 
* Just think, read, listen and __take notes__
* Email me if you have questions. 

## Homework 1A: think and understand
### We buy/use a lot of different products every day
* food every day
* clothes every month
* electronics (e.g. phone) every few years

### However, this can be bad for:
* the people/places where they are collected
* the people/places where they are produced
* the people/places where they are recycled

### Think about these questions:
Click the links _only if you do not understand the question_
* You don't need to read the article - just enough to understand 
* They are difficult, so translation is OK

How often is the answer "I don't know"?
* Were your clothes made by children? https://www.unicef.org/csr/garments.html
* Was your phone made in a safe factory? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides
* Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken? https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=free++range++chicken&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
* Were your cosmetics tested on animals?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_cosmetics_on_animals
* Is there palm oil in your toothpaste? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil
* Will your phone be recycled properly?: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/



### Homework 1B:  Watch this 11 min video
Take notes. 
It's difficult, so if you don't understand:
* Turn on English subtitles (字幕)
* If you still don't understand, turn on Japanese subtitles 
* If you used Japanese, watch it AGAIN with English

### Homework 1C: Read the example essay 
* Read this: [[Examples - example ethical consumption essay]]
* We will write an essay like this 
* Don't worry! 
** The essay was written by a student. You can do this too!
** We will do it __slowly,__ step by step over WEEKS. No rush!

# Project Homework 2 - choose a topic 
### 1) Make a list of products  
* things you used this week
* things you buy regularly
* things you have at home
* things you want to buy
* things you use __at least once a month.__
* things that comes from overseas, probably a third world country
* things you buy things in (packaging)

### 2) Make a list of substances IN the things on your list
Substances are usually worse than final products. The factory that makes earphones might not be a problem, but the metals from Africa used to make them probably are:
* e.g. tungsten in light bulbs
* e.g. cotton in your t-shirts
* e.g. shrimp in your onigiri


### 3) Choose a good topic from you list
Good essay topics are usually:
* things that are simple, usually substances 
* list from step 3 usually better than step 2
** e.g. palm oil, not toothpaste
** e.g. tantalum, not iPhones
** e.g. trees in Malaysia, not notebooks

Do not choose:
* any "products" that are endangered animals (that's essay 2!)
** e.g. no tuna
** e.g. no ivory
* any products I used as an example
** do not choose palm oil (the example essay)
** do not choose tantalum (the video)

### 5) Research your topic A LITTLE
Research enough to know if it's a good topic or not
Research in Japanese is OK. Notes in Japanese are OK. 
Make sure it will be easy to write about:
* cause at least three problems
* have at least three solutions



### 6) Email Malc your idea
* You should be able to write:
** "I chose TOPIC"
** "TOPIC is a kind of... It is..."
** "It causes three problems - 1, 2, and 3"
** "I have maybe found 5 solutions so far. The best 3 are 1, 2, and 3."
* For example
** "I chose Tantalum"
** "Tantalum is a kind of metal. It is used in electronic devices. It comes from Ghana"
** "It causes three problems - it funds conflict, the mining is dangerous, and it causes pollution"
** "I have maybe found 5 solutions so far. The best 3 are all NGOs which are working in the DCR."

# Project Homework 3 - Research your topic more 
### Tip 1: Focus on good sources
* newspaper articles
* government reports
* NGO websites

### Tip 2: Japanese and English
* Using Japanese sources is OK ...
* ... but take notes in English
* In your essay, I want 50% English sources
** Do not copy-paste English notes!
** Read, understand, and write your own notes
** Write keywords, not sentences


## Homework 3A: Research "What is your product?"
* Where does it come from?
* Who makes it?
* What is it used for?
* How is it made?
* How is it similar or different to something we know better?

## Homework 3B: Research Problems (Cause-Effect)
* Important - common mistake
** The focus of this article is problems that __you__ cause for __other__ people/places/things
** Problems caused _for you_ are NOT the topic. 
** If something you buy causes you problems, you can just stop buying it.
** The people who make things can't stop making them, though. 

*  __Think about the WHOLE LIFE of the product__
** Preparations (e.g. deforestation by fire)
** Collection (e.g. mining pollution, slave labour)
** Production (e.g. suicide by workers, factory collapses)
** Recycling (e.g. pollution http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/world/asia/china-electronic-waste-e-waste/ )
*  __Think about the effect on people__
** People producing/collecting/assembling/recycling the thing
** People displaced from the land used
** People living near the place it is made/recycled
*  __Think about the effect on the environment__
** animals
** plants
** soil
** air
** water


## 8) Research Solutions (Paragraph 4 Summary-Response)
* Labelling
** labelling laws (contents, source of materials, location of production)
** labelling groups e.g. Bluesign ( clothing) HSSE ( Jewelry), Dolphin safe (Tuna), Fairtrade (Various), etc
** Farming methods labels (e.g. free range chicken/eggs)
* Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, or avoid completely
** Use less of something
** Use it again for something else.
** Use re-usable instead of disposable things (e.g. EcoBags)
** Avoid it (go vegetarian, keep using your old phone)
** Recycling things you use (e.g. batteries, PET, cans)
** Buying recycled things (e.g. recycled paper)
* Part of purchase goes to charity__
** e.g. http://www.red.org/en/
** e.g. Toms shoes http://www.toms.com/stories/giving/giving-partner-interview-with-coprodeli-in-peru
* Making laws
** International (UN) law
** National (e.g. Japan) law
** Companies voluntary codes
* Activism
** Campaign/Awareness solutions (letter writing).
** Boycott / Protest

## 8) Research Solutions 
* Corruption, lack of enforcement, limited to one area
