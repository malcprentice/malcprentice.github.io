#Aim 
We will write an essay about ethical consumption (倫理的消費) and learn why we need to think carefully about people and the environment before we buy things.

By the end of this project you will be able to:
* Know more about how the things you buy change the world
* Write an academic essay in English 
** Research it and take notes
** Arrange your research well
** Write sentences in academic English style
** Format (フォーマット) it well
** Cite your sources (出典を引用します) in "APA style" (アメリカ心理学会論文作成)

# Contents
* This project will take WEEKS. 
* Follow your syllabus for Homework 1, 2, 3, etc
* Don't read ahead too far! I need to explain some things for each homework.

# Project Homework  1 - Introduction 
* You __do not have to submit anything__ for Homework 1. 
* Just think, read, listen and __take notes__
* Email me if you have questions. 

## Homework 1A: think and understand
### We buy/use a lot of different products every day
* food every day
* clothes every month
* electronics (e.g. phone) every few years

### However, this can be bad for:
* the people/places where they are collected
* the people/places where they are produced
* the people/places where they are recycled

### Think about these questions:
Click the links _only if you do not understand the question_
* You don't need to read the article - just enough to understand 
* They are difficult, so translation is OK

How often is the answer "I don't know"?
* Were your clothes made by children? https://www.unicef.org/csr/garments.html
* Was your phone made in a safe factory? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides
* Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken? https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=free++range++chicken&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8
* Were your cosmetics tested on animals?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_cosmetics_on_animals
* Is there palm oil in your toothpaste? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil
* Will your phone be recycled properly?: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/



## Homework 1B:  Watch this 11 min video
Take notes. 
It's difficult, so if you don't understand:
* Turn on English subtitles (字幕)
* If you still don't understand, turn on Japanese subtitles 
* If you used Japanese, watch it AGAIN with English

## Homework 1C: Read the example essay 
* Read this: [[Examples - example ethical consumption essay]]
* We will write an essay like this 
* Don't worry! 
** The essay was written by a student. You can do this too!
** We will do it __slowly,__ step by step over WEEKS. No rush!

# Project Homework 2 - choose a topic 
### 1) Make a list of products  
* things you used this week
* things you buy regularly
* things you have at home
* things you want to buy
* things you use __at least once a month.__
* things that comes from overseas, probably a third world country
* things you buy things in (packaging)

### 2) Make a list of substances IN the things on your list
Substances are usually worse than final products. The factory that makes earphones might not be a problem, but the metals from Africa used to make them probably are:
* e.g. tungsten in light bulbs
* e.g. cotton in your t-shirts
* e.g. shrimp in your onigiri


### 3) Choose a good topic from you list
Good essay topics are usually:
* things that are simple, usually substances 
* list from step 2 usually better than step 1
** e.g. palm oil, not toothpaste
** e.g. tantalum, not iPhones
** e.g. trees in Malaysia, not notebooks

Do not choose:
* any "products" that are endangered animals (that's essay 2!)
** e.g. no tuna
** e.g. no ivory
* any products I used as an example
** do not choose palm oil (the example essay)
** do not choose tantalum (the video)

### 5) Read your topic A LITTLE
You will research more later. 
For now, just research enough to check it is a good topic:
* Google your topic
* Research in Japanese/your language is OK. 
* Read ANYTHING, even bad sources like Wikipedia
* Notes in Japanese/your language are OK. 

Is this a good topic or not?
* Is it interesting 
* Does it cause __three__ problems
* Does it have  __three__ solutions

### 6) Email Malc your idea to check
You should be able to write:
* "I chose TOPIC"
* "TOPIC is ... It ..."
* "There are at least three problems, for example 1, 2, and 3"
* "There are at least three solutions, for example 1, 2, and 3."

For example
> __I chose__ Tantalum. Tantalum __is__ a kind of metal used in electronic devices. It comes from Ghana. __There are at least three solutions, for example__ child soldiers, death in mines, and pollution. __There are at least three solutions, for example__ fair trade phones, recycling, and UNICEF's work in the Congo"

# Project Homework 3 - Research your product and problems

###First, learn how to find good sources
A very detailed look is here: [[Invention - find good sources]]

However, the short version is: 
* Focus on good sources
** newspaper articles
** government reports
** NGO websites
* Avoid bad sources
** No Dictionaries
** No Wikipedia, no Wikis, no pedias, including Encyclopaedias.
** No "question answering" sites (Quora, Yahoo, About.com)

### Japanese OK?
* Yes, using Japanese sources is OK
* BUT take notes in English!
** Do not copy-paste English notes!
** Read, understand, and write your own notes
** Write keywords, not sentences
* In your essay, I want __50% English sources__


## Homework 3A: Research "What is your product?"
* Where does it come from?
* Who makes it?
* What is it used for?
* How is it made?
* How is it similar or different to something we know better?

## Homework 3B: Research Problems (Cause-Effect)
### Important - common mistake
* This essay is about problems that __you__ cause for __other__ people/places/things when you shop
* Problems caused _for you_ are NOT the topic. You can just stop buying it.
* The people who make things can't stop making them, though. 
* For example:
** WRONG: "cigarettes give people cancer" is not a problem - just stop smoking. 
** RIGHT: "children picking tobacco leaves get nicotine poisoning" 
** WRONG: "eating hamburgers makes me fat"
** RIGHT: "meat production is a cause of global warming"


### Think about the WHOLE LIFE of the product
* Preparations (e.g. deforestation by fire)
* Collection (e.g. mining pollution, slave labour)
* Production (e.g. suicide by workers, factory collapses)
* Recycling (e.g. pollution http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/world/asia/china-electronic-waste-e-waste/ )

### Think about the effect on people
* People producing/collecting/assembling/recycling the thing
* People displaced from the land used
* People living near the place it is made/recycled

### Think about the effect on the environment
* animals
* plants
* soil
* air
* water


# Project Homework 4 - Research your solutions and responses
Find at least three solutions
Choose solutions that are happening NOW, not in the past or future
Solutions are usually:
* Things students can do
* Things NGOs, governments, etc, are doing
* Things companies are doing 


### Some ideas for solutions
* Labelling laws (dolphin safe tuna)
* Fairtrade and similar programs
* Any NGO working on the problem
* Any NGO working on a related problem (poverty)
* Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, or avoid completely
* Part of purchase goes to charity e.g. http://www.red.org/en/
* Making laws
** International (UN) law
** National (e.g. Japan) law
** Companies voluntary codes
* Activism
** Campaign/Awareness solutions (letter writing).
** Boycott / Protest

###  Research Responses 
In your essay, you will write sentences like
* "However, this solution is only partly effective, because..."
* "In fact, this solution is working very welll - for example...

Research which one you will use for each solution! 

Do your solutions actually work? 
If they were all perfect there wouldn't be a problem. 

Probably:
* They only work in one country
* They only work 20%
* They haven't been working very long
* There are problems with corruption
* They don't have enough money
