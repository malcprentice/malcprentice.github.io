The easiest way to get formatting right is:
* Use the template I sent you!
* Don't break it!
* However, if you break it, here is the rules it uses:

# Times New Roman, 12 pt font.
* Check _everything,_ including title and references
* The template is in colour, but the essay should be printed __black__
** do NOT just print it black (orange comes out grey).
** Actually change the colour before you print


# Double space body text
** MENU: 書式--->段落---> 行間---> 二行)
** RIBBON: ホーム--->段落 ---> 行間---> 二行)
** DO NOT double space info or outlines.

# Normal sized margins (余白)
* 2.54cm (one inch) margins on all sides (レイアウト→余白)

# Name, number, class, code, and date
* Don’t forget the proper code (QW2, V3, A2, etc)
* Date is the deadline of this homework. No "th" or "st" (e.g. April 24, 2015)

# Indent the first line of every paragraph
* In Japanese Microsoft Word, the tab size is often too small
* Find "tabs" in 書式 and set them to 1.27cm
* You could also add 4-5 spaces instead, but this is bad style

# Title 
* Center  (中央揃え)
* No more than 12 words (shorten long QW topics)
* 12pt Times New Roman
* No bold/italics/underline
* [[Style - use title case]]

# Empty lines between sections
* One empty line between info and title.
* One empty line between title and text.
* One empty line between text and references.


# Correct Alignment 
Right, left, center, never justified)
In Word, ホーム-->段落

|Align how?		|Align what?
|----------------|-----------------
|Right align		|Info & Word Count
|Left align 		|Paragraphs
|Center align 	     |Title
|Justify			|NOTHING! (spaces stretches in a strange way)
