# Aim
The aim of outline practice is:
* Find something to listen to
* Find something to read
* Take notes on both
* Present in pairs, groups, or to the class
* Discuss
** Write good discussion questions
** Lead a discussion
** Participate in a discussion
* Learn to use APA References
* Learn to summarise


# Step 1 - listen, read and take notes
## 1) Visit the TED website https://www.ted.com/talks
* Select the option for a short talk (no more than 12 mins)
* Select a topic (e.g. Technology, Education)
* Look for an interesting title
* Don't choose these ones - I use them in some classes
** Ernesto Sirolli (on effectiveness of aid, and also body language for presentations): https://www.ted.com/talks/ernesto_sirolli_want_to_help_someone_shut_up_and_listen/up-next?language=en
** Daniela Papi (also on effectiveness, this time volunteering - I use this one for the Voluntourism essay): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYWl6Wz2NB8  
** Angela Duckworth (on "grit" - the ability to keep going when things get tough - being more important than anything for students and others): https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance/up-next?language=en
** Dan Ariely (Behavioural Economist - some bits from his book "Predictably Irrational" - cheating and identity, the importance of check intuitions): https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_our_buggy_moral_code?language=en (some more bits here: https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_are_we_in_control_of_our_own_decisions/transcript?language=en )
** Angel Chang on sneakers (talk has same Arrangement as Ethical Consumption essay): https://www.ted.com/talks/angel_chang_the_wildly_complex_anatomy_of_a_sneaker?language=en
** Hans Rosling on global population: https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_on_global_population_growth?language=en


## 2) When you have chosen a talk
* Listen to the first minute. 
* Listen to 20 seconds, English only.
* Too difficult?
** Try English subtitles or transcript
** Try Japanese subtitles or transcript
** But do try later ONE more time in English 


## 3) Google the topic covered in the talk. Find one thing to READ
Anything OK! 
* A news article
* A website
* Song lyrics
* Something that agrees or disagrees - both OK
* It doesn't have to be an exact match to the topic

## 4) Watch the talk, read the article. Take notes on both
* First just take rough notes any way you want. 
* In step 2, later, I will tell you how to organise your notes


# Step 2: Get your Presentation ready
## 1) Find the template
* I will share "Template for Outline" on Google Classroom later
* Read the notes! 
* Read the rubric 
* Rename the file
** "Hiroko Sato - SSB - RR1"
** "Hiroki Sato - ECS - RR2"
** "Hiroki Sato - GCP - RR3"
* Change the Title, information


## 2) Type up your notes in correct format
* Use the template to get proper formatting
** No lonely bullet points!
** No strange font sizes or colours. Formatting has meaning!
** No sentences except for summary - notes are keywords
* No copy pasting! [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]

## 3) Write a summary sentence for the reading
* One sentence only
* See [[Style - write a summary sentence]]
 
## 4) Write a summary sentence for the reading
* One sentence only
* See [[Style - write a summary sentence]]

### Link it properly! Some options:
|However, 		|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|says that
|In fact, 		|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|notes that
|Additionally, 	|Suzuki (2018, Febrary 1) 	|points out that
|For example, 	|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|describes

|Link 				|SOURCE TYPE 			|source  					|citation word+  reading summary 		|Citation
|--------------------|---------------		|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------
|However 			|, an article 			|in the Washington Post 	|notes that this is not true because X	|(Smith, 2019, January 1)
|Despite this 		|, a law 				|passed by the US congress 	|has banned X 							|(Yamada, n.d.)
|Meanwhile, 			|, protestors 			|are claiming that  		|this will have (no/real) impact, as X  |(UNESCO, 2017)
|On the other hand 	|, data collected  		|by a survey agency 		|shows this is (un)true, since 			|("UNESCO," 2017)
|Elsewhere, however 	|, similar work 		|by another GROUP 			|(does not) confirm this to be the case	|("Trees," 2016b)
|In fact 		  	|, recent research by 	|scientists working for the UN|has (dis)proved 						|("Newts," 2018, June 3)
|In addition			|, a report 			|by the Department of Work	|suggests otherwise, as X				|("Penguins," n.d.)
|Supporting this 	|, recent evidence from |satellite imaging 			|clearly indicates that X 				|(Suzuki, 2017)
|Confirming this are |recent reports  		|by local NGOs 				|that X 								|
|Casting doubt on this|,a recent report 		|by a government spokesperson|rejects X 							|


## 5) Write a response sentence. 
* One sentence only
* See [[Style - write a response]]

## 6) Write three good discussion questions
Good discussion questions must start THREE DISCUSSIONS about the topic!
See [[Study Skills - ask good questions]] for example patterns
* No quiz questions - questions with a "right answer" do not start a good discussion.
* No overlapping questions e.g. "Do you like dogs / Do you want dogs / Do you have dogs"
* No questions with an obvious answer (e.g. "Have you ever been to Mongolia?")
* No questions that need research to answer e.g. "How can we reduce water pollution in Bangladesh?"
* Don't ask "Do you know TOPIC" (of course they do - you just explained it
* No lazy questions (questions which work for any topic). Be SPECIFIC
** e.g. this is banned: "What do you think about this topic?"
** e.g. this is banned: "What is your image of TOPIC"
** e.g. this is banned: "How do you feel about TOPIC"
** Instead, be specific - "Do you think TOPIC is SPECIFIC QUESTION"


## 7) Add APA citation to summaries and at the bottom of slides
* See [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]


## 8) complete the References section
* See [[Invention - use APA format in reference lists]]


# Step 3: Present
<red>Online 2020 - we might not be able to practice eye contact and gestures presenting online</red>
* Present, including your summary and response
** Notes OK, but that will hurt your gestures and eye contact. If you do:
** A4 printed sheet is easiest. Tablet OK. Phone too small. Laptop too big.
* Lead a discussion using your questions
* Malc will check
** If this is practice, I will give feedback
** If graded, I will give a grade
** Read rubric for how this is marked
