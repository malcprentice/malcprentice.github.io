# Aim
The aim of an "RR" outline is
* Find something to listen to
* Find something to read
* Take notes on both
* Present in pairs, groups, or to the class
* Discuss
** Write good discussion questions
** Lead a discussion
** Participate in a discussion
* Learn to use APA References
* Learn to summarise

# 1) Find the template
* "Template for Outline (RR) SLIDES"
* Read the notes

# 2) Get ready
* Rename the file
** "Hiroko Sato - SSB - RR1"
** "Hiroki Sato - ECS - RR2"
** "Hiroki Sato - GCP - RR3"
* Change the Title, information

# 3) Find something to read or listen to.
## General Instructions
* Follow the syllabus - I might requires one or more thigns to read/lisetn to.
* Take rough notes
* Focus on important Names/Numbers/Dates/Facts/Reasons/Examples
* CHeck your syllabus for the target
* A good article is something INTERESTING your partner MIGHT NOT KNOW
** not "Tokyo Sky Tree Opens" (everyone knows the story already)
** not "Daisuke Matsui transfers to Slavia Sofia" (not everyone likes football)
* Most students say they take 50-60 minutes to do this report.


## 1) For a news article:
Visit [[Resources - websites for English news articles]]
* Choose a site.
* Choose an interesting section on the site
** The front page is often boring: Tech/Business might be more interesting, depending on your major
* Choose an article.
** The "Simplified" category should not be used by some classes. Check your syllabus!
** Internet news (e.g. Yahoo) is often shorter and easier
** News indexes (Google, Reuters) are good for finding a topic
* Read critically
** Many newspapers are politically biased.
** Some are tightly controlled by different governments or groups.
** Try to read more than one source/side before you believe anything you read.
* APA reference for News Website is here: http://alba-english.org/Invention%20-%20use%20APA%20format%20for%20reference%20lists.html# Newspaper

 

## For a lecture
See [[Projects - outline a lecture]]

## For an easy book
### 1) Get a book
* Non-fiction is best for RR outline. Fiction is OK for logs.
* You can borrow books from the library(1F, far right wall).
* You can read books in Space, but not borrow them.
* If you are not on campus, try ER Central: http://www.er-central.com/
* Read the first page. It should be easy
** you should know 98% of the words without a dictionary
** if you don't, go down a level.

### 2) Read it
* You only need to read for 30 minutes.
* You can do your RR even if you haven't finished the book.
* Do try to finish the book later though

### 3) Doing an RR outline? Follow the general instructions
* Instructions are here: [[Projects - outline]]
* APA reference for the References section is here: http://alba-english.org/Invention%20-%20use%20APA%20format%20in%20reference%20lists.html# Graded Readers
* APA for your Summary is here: [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]

### Finished your RR outline? Remember!
* Reading improves your English, including TOEIC score: http://jalt-publications.org/archive/proceedings/2009/E035.pd
* Check your syllabus for details - you might be able to get extra points for more reading



##  For a difficult reading of another kind
* Read the summary/description (if available)
* Try to guess what the author will say
* Skim the first and last paragraph
* Read the summary/abstract, if there is one.
* Read the whole thing. Option: highlight the interesting points
* Take rough notes on scrap paper
* Do you have enough notesd for a 3-4 minute presentation? If not, read again or read a second article

## For a song
When I ask beginning first-year students with good English, particularly good pronunciation, where they learned, I usually get two answers:
* study abroad
* listened to song lyrics

So if I say "Free Topic" for RR, one option available is to use song lyrics.

However, its more than just listening to a song. You should:
* download the lyrics
* read them carefully and try to understand 100%
* listen multiple times until you can hear the words in the song
* optional: do it in karaoke!
* Lyrics Training: http://lyricstraining.com/ (also handy for typing practice)
* Lyrics search: http://azlyrics.com  (or just Google song name plus "lyrics")


# 4) Type up your rough notes
## Use the template to get proper formatting
* NO lonely points!
** No I without II
** no 1 without 2
** no A without B

## Don't plagiarize!
* Read this: [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]
* Now read this: [[Invention - quote and paraphrase]]
* 99% of your notes should be summaries
* This means the notes should use your OWN WORDS, not copy-paste
* Tip: try taking notes in Japanese, then change to English later
* Don't use quotes ("") unless the EXACT words are IMPORTANT (e.g. "I have a dream")

# 5)Write a one sentence summary
See [[Style - write a summary sentence]]


# 6) Write three good discussion questions
* Check the [[Resources - marking rubric for RR report]] for detail
### Good discussion questions must start THREE DISCUSSIONS about the topic!
* No quiz questions - questions with a "right answer" do not start a good discussion.
* No overlapping questions e.g. "Do you like dogs / Do you want dogs / Do you have dogs"
* No questions with an obvious answer (e.g. * ""Have you ever been to Mongolia?")
* No questions that need research to answer e.g. "How can we reduce water pollution in Bangladesh?"
* Don't ask "Do you know TOPIC" (of course they do - you just explained it
* No lazy questions (questions which work for any topic). Be SPECIFIC
** e.g. this is banned: "What do you think about this topic?"
** e.g. this is banned: "What is your image of TOPIC"
** e.g. this is banned: "How do you feel about TOPIC"
** Instead, be specific - "Do you think TOPIC is SPECIFIC QUESTION"

### Use clear question patterns
See [[Study Skills - ask good questions]] for examples.

# 7) Add APA citation to summary, and complete the References section
* Subtitle is "References" - 12pt BOLD left aligned Times New Roman (just use the template)
* Remember to [[Invention - use APA format in reference lists]]
* If more than one reference, make sure they are in alphabetical order (123...abcd...z)

# 8) Bring it to class
* You should be able to hold your notes in one hand and read them easily.
** A4 printed sheet is easiest
** Tablet OK. Small folding laptop OK.
** Phone too small. Print it.
** Large or non-folding laptop too big. Print it.
In class, we will:
* Practice presentations
* Discuss the questions
* Check for problems in outlines, references, etc
