# Aim
The aim of outline practice is:
* Find something to listen to
* Find something to read
* Take notes on both
* Write a summary 
* Present in pairs, groups, or to the class
* Discuss
** Write good discussion questions
** Lead a discussion
** Participate in a discussion
* Learn to use APA References
* Learn to summarise


# Step 1: Listen, read and take notes
### 1A) Visit the TED website https://www.ted.com/talks
* Select a topic (e.g. Technology, Education)
* Select "6-12 mins" - no shorter.
* Look for an interesting title
* At the bottom of this page is a list of talks I use in class. Don't choose those. 

### 1B) When you have chosen a talk
* Listen to 20 seconds, English only.
* Too difficult?
** Try English subtitles or transcript
** Try Japanese subtitles or transcript
** But try later ONE more time later in English 


### 1C) Google the topic covered in the talk. Find one thing to READ
Anything related to topic OK! 
* A news article
* A website
* Song lyrics
* Something that agrees or disagrees - both OK
* It doesn't have to be an exact match
** For example if talk is _"problem caused for penguins in Galapagos by global warming",_ your reading could be about any combination of:
** a) The Galapagos 
** b) OR penguins 
** c) OR global warming
* Advanced option: Read [[Invention - find good sources]]

### 1D) Take notes on the TED Talk AND the article
* For now, just take rough notes _any way you want._
* You'll need enough notes to talk for 3-5 minutes on your topic
* You'll need 9 ideas (steps, times, reasons, problems, solutions) 
* If you don't have 3-5 minutes and 9 key ideas, read another article!
* Remember to keep the URL (http addresses) of the talk and article
* In step 2, you will learn how to Arrange and Present your notes


# Step 2: Get your Presentation ready
### 2A) Find the template
* I will share "Template for Outline" on Google Classroom later
* Read the notes! 
* Read the rubric 
* Rename the file
** "Hiroko Sato - SSB - RR1"
** "Hiroki Sato - ECS - RR2"
** "Hiroki Sato - GCP - RR3"
* Change the Title, information

### 2B) Type up your notes in correct format
* Use the template to get proper formatting
** No lonely bullet points!
** No strange font sizes or colours. Formatting has meaning!
* No sentences in notes. 
** Notes are keywords. 
** Sentences are only for Questions and Summary
* No copy pasting! [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]

### 2C) Write a summary
* One summary sentence for the lecture 
* One summary sentence for the reading
* Make the link between them CLEAR (support? disagree? disprove? add detail?)
* See [[Style - write a summary sentence]]
* Don't forget to cite BOTH articles in the summary

|However, 		|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|says that
|In fact, 		|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|notes that
|Additionally, 	|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|points out that
|For example, 	|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|describes

|Link 				|SOURCE TYPE 			|source  					|citation word+  reading summary 		|Citation

|However 			|, an article 			|in the Washington Post 	|notes that this is not true because X	|(Smith, 2019, January 1)
|Despite this 		|, a law 				|passed by the US congress 	|has banned X 							|(Yamada, n.d.)
|Meanwhile, 			|, protestors 			|are claiming that  		|this will have (no/real) impact, as X  |(UNESCO, 2017)
|On the other hand 	|, data collected  		|by a survey agency 		|shows this is (un)true, since 			|("UNESCO," 2017)

### 2D) Response
* CORRECTION! There is an error in the slides I sent. 
* "REsponse" should not be on summary slide
* Just TWO things on summary slide (one for lecture, one for reading)
** TWO keywords in slide
** TWO sentences in notes
* Ignore "write a response: instructions
* Response should only be on "Learning Reflection" slide
* 

### 2E) Learning Reflection
* What was easy? What was difficult? Move the ticks. 
* Write a personal response: http://alba-english.org/Style%20-%20write%20a%20response.html

### 2F) Write three good discussion questions
Good discussion questions must start THREE DISCUSSIONS about the topic!
See [[Study Skills - ask good questions]] for example patterns
* No quiz questions - questions with a "right answer" do not start a good discussion.
* No overlapping questions e.g. "Do you like dogs / Do you want dogs / Do you have dogs"
* No questions with an obvious answer (e.g. "Have you ever been to Mongolia?")
* No questions that need research to answer e.g. "How can we reduce water pollution in Bangladesh?"
* Don't ask "Do you know TOPIC" (of course they do - you just explained it
* No lazy questions (questions which work for any topic). Be SPECIFIC
** e.g. this is banned: "What do you think about this topic?"
** e.g. this is banned: "What is your image of TOPIC"
** e.g. this is banned: "How do you feel about TOPIC"
** Instead, be specific - "Do you think TOPIC is SPECIFIC QUESTION"


### 2G) Add APA citations 
* See [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]
* TWO places for APA "In the text" citations:
** At the bottom of each slide. Make it clear which slides used which source
** In the summary in the speaker notes, after each sentence.
* ONE References section
** Look on last slide
** See [[Invention - use APA format in reference lists]]
* Consider trying Zotero
** Download here: https://www.zotero.org/
** It makes mistakes - check it by hand for errors
** It words on Google Docs and Word, but not Slides. You'll need to copy-paste the references. 

# Step 3: Present
* Present, including your summary and response
* Presentations work best if you remember the material, and use the keywords on the slide to remind you about details and what to say
* Notes are OK, but will make eye contact and gestures more difficult 
** General tip: Make sure the text is big enough to read
** Don't use "presenter notes" in PowerPoint or Google Slides on Zoom. For normal presentations they are OK.
** If you can buy or make them, index cards work well: https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=index+cards
** No floppy paper - A4 is too big. B5 notebook better
** Devices OK: Tablets best. Phone usually too small. Laptops too big unless they are small foldable ones.

* Finish
** Read your summary
** Quickly review "learning reflection" and response
** Lead a discussion using your questions
* Remember to SUBMIT your slides on Google Classroom. 
** Malc will check
** If this is practice, I will give feedback
** If graded, I will give a grade
