#Aim
The aim of an "RR" outline is"
*Finding a good source to read/listen to
*Reading or listening to something challengin
*Taking notes
*Presenting in pairs, groups, or to the class
*Discussing
**Writing good discussion questions
**Leading a discussion
**Participating in a discussion
*APA references
*Summarising
*Formatting office documents



#1) Find the materials.
Are you doing Outline or Powerpoint RR?

##"TEMPLATE for RR OUTLINE" (typed) has:
*an outline section (I, II, III, A, B, C, etc)
*a summary section
*discussion question section
*References

##"TEMPLATE for RR POWERPOINT" (slides) has
*Title slide
*Background slide
*Three slides with tips
*Discussion Question slide
*References slide

##Find the EXAMPLES
*In the shared folder
*Look at the [[Resources - marking rubric for RR report]]
*If your homework requires TWO OR MORE sources, read this: [[Projects - outline and combine sources]]



#2) Get ready
*Rename the file
**"Hiroko Sato - SSB - RR1"
**"Hiroki Sato - ECS - RR2"
**"Hiroki Sato - GCA - RR3"
**Get the code from your Syllabus
*Change the information __inside__ the template.
**You will need: name, number, class, code, date, and title
**Follow the date example carefully
**[[Style - use title case]] for your title


#3) Find something to read or listen to.
##General Instructions
*Follow the syllabus - I might requires one or more thigns to read/lisetn to.
*Take rough notes
*Focus on important Names/Numbers/Dates/Facts/Reasons/Examples
*CHeck your syllabus for the target
*A good article is something INTERESTING your partner MIGHT NOT KNOW
**not "Tokyo Sky Tree Opens" (everyone knows the story already)
**not "Daisuke Matsui transfers to Slavia Sofia" (not everyone likes football)
*Most students say they take 50-60 minutes to do this report.


##1) For a news article:
Visit [[Resources - websites for English news articles]]
*Choose a site.
*Choose an interesting section on the site
**The front page is often boring: Tech/Business might be more interesting, depending on your major
*Choose an article.
**The "Simplified" category should not be used by some classes. Check your syllabus!
**Internet news (e.g. Yahoo) is often shorter and easier
**News indexes (Google, Reuters) are good for finding a topic
*Read critically
**Many newspapers are politically biased.
**Some are tightly controlled by different governments or groups.
**Try to read more than one source/side before you believe anything you read.
*APA reference for News Website is here: http://alba-english.org/Invention%20-%20use%20APA%20format%20for%20reference%20lists.html#Newspaper


##For an SRA Card
*B level class only.
*SRA are A4 folded cards in four boxes in the self access centre.
*Each card has an easy reading aout Science and a quiz.
*Read the card, take the quiz, and take notes.
*Take notes! Don't copy the card
*In class, I want to see you notes and your quiz as well as your RR



##For a lecture
See [[Projects - outline a lecture]]

##For an easy book
###1) Get a book
*Non-fiction is best for RR outline. Fiction is OK for logs.
*You can borrow books from the library(1F, far right wall).
*You can read books in Space, but not borrow them.
*If you are not on campus, try ER Central: http://www.er-central.com/
*Read the first page. It should be easy
**you should know 98% of the words without a dictionary
**if you don't, go down a level.

###2) Read it
*You only need to read for 30 minutes.
*You can do your RR even if you haven't finished the book.
*Do try to finish the book later though

###3) Doing an RR outline? Follow the general instructions
*Instructions are here: [[Projects - outline]]
*APA reference for the References section is here: http://alba-english.org/Invention%20-%20use%20APA%20format%20in%20reference%20lists.html#Graded Readers
*APA for your Summary is here: [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]

###Finished your RR outline? Remember!
*Reading improves your English, including TOEIC score: http://jalt-publications.org/archive/proceedings/2009/E035.pd
*Check your syllabus for details - you might be able to get extra points for more reading



## For a difficult reading of another kind
*Read the summary/description (if available)
*Try to guess what the author will say
*Skim the first and last paragraph
*Read the summary/abstract, if there is one.
*Read the whole thing. Option: highlight the interesting points
*Take rough notes on scrap paper
*Do you have enough notesd for a 3-4 minute presentation? If not, read again or read a second article

##FOr a song
When I ask beginning first-year students with good English, particularly good pronunciation, where they learned, I usually get two answers:
*study abroad
*listened to song lyrics

So if I say "Free Topic" for RR, one option available is to use song lyrics.

However, its more than just listening to a song. You should:
*download the lyrics
*read them carefully and try to understand 100%
*listen multiple times until you can hear the words in the song
*optional: do it in karaoke!
*Lyrics Training: http://lyricstraining.com/ (also handy for typing practice)
*Lyrics search: http://azlyrics.com  (or just Google song name plus "lyrics")




#4) Type up your rough notes
##Use the template to get proper formatting
*NO lonely points!
**No I without II
**no 1 without 2
**no A without B

##Don't plagiarize!
*Read this: [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]
*Now read this: [[Invention - quote and paraphrase]]
*99% of your notes should be summaries
*This means the notes should use your OWN WORDS, not copy-paste
*Tip: try taking notes in Japanese, then change to English later
*Don't use quotes ("") unless the EXACT words are IMPORTANT (e.g. "I have a dream")

##Use Note English
Outlines should be FAST to write and FAST to read:
*No sentences!
*Important information only
*Remove unnecessary words (a, he, on, in, the, is, are)


*Look at these: which one can you write quicker? which one can you read quicker when presenting?
**"Two thirds of growth at Pepsi came from better foods"
**"two thirds growth Pepsi frm better foods"
**"2/3 growth @ Pepsi = better foods"

#5)Write a one sentence summary
See [[Style - write a summary sentence]]


#6) Write three good discussion questions
*Check the [[Resources - marking rubric for RR report]] for detail
###Good discussion questions must start THREE DISCUSSIONS about the topic!
*No quiz questions - questions with a "right answer" do not start a good discussion.
*No overlapping questions e.g. "Do you like dogs / Do you want dogs / Do you have dogs"
*No questions with an obvious answer (e.g. *""Have you ever been to Mongolia?")
*No questions that need research to answer e.g. "How can we reduce water pollution in Bangladesh?"
*Don't ask "Do you know TOPIC" (of course they do - you just explained it
*No lazy questions (questions which work for any topic). Be SPECIFIC
**e.g. this is banned: "What do you think about this topic?"
**e.g. this is banned: "What is your image of TOPIC"
**e.g. this is banned: "How do you feel about TOPIC"
**Instead, be specific - "Do you think TOPIC is SPECIFIC QUESTION"

###Use clear question patterns
See [[Study Skills - ask good questions]] for examples.

#7) Add APA citation to summary, and complete the References section
*Subtitle is "References" - 12pt BOLD left aligned Times New Roman (just use the template)
*Remember to [[Invention - use APA format in reference lists]]
*If more than one reference, make sure they are in alphabetical order (123...abcd...z)

#8) Bring it to class
*You should be able to hold your notes in one hand and read them easily.
**A4 printed sheet is easiest
**Tablet OK. Small folding laptop OK.
**Phone too small. Print it.
**Large or non-folding laptop too big. Print it.
In class, we will:
*Practice presentations
*Discuss the questions
*Check for problems in outlines, references, etc

#9) Email it to Malc only if graded
**RR1, RR3, & RR5 are not graded. Do not email me.
**RR2, RR4 and RR6 __are__ graded. Email me the file. **See [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]]
