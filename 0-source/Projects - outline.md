# Aim
The aim of outline practice is:
* Find something to listen to
* Find something to read
* Take notes on both
* Write a summary 
* Present in pairs, groups, or to the class
* Discuss
** Write good discussion questions
** Lead a discussion
** Participate in a discussion
* Learn to use APA References
* Learn to summarise


# Step 1: Listen, read and take notes
### 1A) Visit the TED website https://www.ted.com/talks
* Select a topic (e.g. Technology, Education)
* Select "6-12 mins" - no shorter.
* Look for an interesting title
* At the bottom of this page is a list of talks I use in class. Don't choose those. 

### 1B) When you have chosen a talk
* Listen to 20 seconds, English only.
* Too difficult?
** Try English subtitles or transcript
** Try Japanese subtitles or transcript
** But try later ONE more time later in English 


### 1C) Google the topic covered in the talk. Find one thing to READ
Anything related to topic OK! 
* A news article
* A website
* Song lyrics
* Something that agrees or disagrees - both OK
* It doesn't have to be an exact match
** For example if talk is _"problem caused for penguins in Galapagos by global warming",_ your reading could be about any combination of:
** a) The Galapagos 
** b) OR penguins 
** c) OR global warming
* Advanced option: Read [[Invention - find good sources]]

### 1D) Take notes on the TED Talk AND the article
* For now, just take rough notes _any way you want._
* You'll need enough notes to talk for 3-5 minutes on your topic
* You'll need 9 ideas (steps, times, reasons, problems, solutions) 
* If you don't have 3-5 minutes and 9 key ideas, read another article!
* Remember to keep the URL (http addresses) of the talk and article
* In step 2, you will learn how to Arrange and Present your notes


# Step 2: Get your Presentation ready (9 slides minimum)
### Find the template
* I will share "Template for Outline" on Google Classroom later
* Read the notes! 
* Read the rubric 
* Rename the file
** "Hiroko Sato - SSB - RR1"
** "Hiroki Sato - ECS - RR2"
** "Hiroki Sato - GCP - RR3"

### Slide 1
* Change the Title, information

### Slide 2
Give 3 keywords
* General background e.g. Global warming, Canada, Penguins
* Specific background e.g. Typhoons increasing, Toronto, Emperor penguins
* Importance background - optional - only if it is not clear why I should care about penguins


### Slide 3/4/5) Type up your notes in correct format
* Use the template to get proper formatting
** No lonely bullet points!
** No strange font sizes or colours. Formatting has meaning!
* No sentences in notes. 
** Notes are keywords. 
** Sentences are only for Questions and Summary
* No copy pasting! [[Invention - recognise and avoid plagiarism]]
* Don't forget the APA citation
* NO penguins! Change the images. 
** Images can just be for decoration, no APA citation necessary
** Charts and maps etc are better, but if you use one give the APA citation

### Slide 6) Write a summary
* One summary sentence for the lecture 
* One summary sentence for the reading
* Make the link between them CLEAR (support? disagree? disprove? add detail?)
* See [[Style - write a summary sentence]]
* Don't forget to cite BOTH articles in the summary

### Slide 6 CORRECTION! There is an error in the Summary slide I sent. 
* "Response" should not be on summary slide
* Just TWO things on summary slide (one for lecture, one for reading)
** TWO keywords in summary slide
** TWO sentences in summary notes
* Ignore "write a response" 
* Response should only be on "Learning Reflection" slide below

### Slide 7) Learning Reflection
* What was easy? What was difficult? Move the green ticks. 
* Write a personal response on THIS slide at bottom: http://alba-english.org/Style%20-%20write%20a%20response.html

### Slide 8) Write three good discussion questions
Good discussion questions must start THREE DISCUSSIONS about the topic!
See [[Study Skills - ask good questions]] for example patterns
* No quiz questions - questions with a "right answer" do not start a good discussion.
* No overlapping questions e.g. "Do you like dogs / Do you want dogs / Do you have dogs"
* No questions with an obvious answer (e.g. "Have you ever been to Mongolia?")
* No questions that need research to answer e.g. "How can we reduce water pollution in Bangladesh?"
* Don't ask "Do you know TOPIC" (of course they do - you just explained it
* No lazy questions (questions which work for any topic). Be SPECIFIC
** e.g. this is banned: "What do you think about this topic?"
** e.g. this is banned: "What is your image of TOPIC"
** e.g. this is banned: "How do you feel about TOPIC"
** Instead, be specific - "Do you think TOPIC is SPECIFIC QUESTION"

### Slide 9) Add APA citations 
* See [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]
* TWO places for APA "In the text" citations:
** At the bottom of each slide. Make it clear which slides used which source
** In the summary in the speaker notes, after each sentence.
* ONE References section
** Look on last slide
** See [[Invention - use APA format in reference lists]]
* Consider trying Zotero
** Download here: https://www.zotero.org/
** It makes mistakes - check it by hand for errors
** It words on Google Docs and Word, but not Slides. You'll need to copy-paste the references. 

# Step 3: Present (Zoom version)
## Preparing before class
* Practice doing your presentation 3-4 times for fluency
* Use Zoom on laptop not ipad/phone if possible
* Use Chrome or Firefox, not Edge, and NEVER USE INTERNET EXPLORER FOR ANYTHING!
* Download slides  so the presentation is smoother
** Google Sheets "File->Make Available Offline"
** OR if you are having problems with that, download as PowerPoint
* Decide whether or not to use notes. T
** Best option is not to need notes 
** KNOW the topic very well
** use the slide KEYWORDS to remind you what is next
** notes just for numbers, names, other things it's hard to remember 
* If you need longer notes
** BE CAREFUL. They will make eye contact and gestures more difficult 
** "Presenter notes" in PowerPoint or Google Slides don't work on Zoom
** Make sure the text is big enough to read
** No floppy paper - A4 is too big. B5 notebook better
** Index cards work well: https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=index+cards
** Devices OK: Tablets good. Phones too small. Laptops usually too big. 
* Before class, remember to SUBMIT your slides on Google Classroom. 

## Preparing in class
* Change your Zoom name to add your team A or B e.g. "Hiroko Sato (B)"
* Presenters, turn your video on so everyone can make eye contact
* At least one audience member turn on video too if possible
* Presenters - put your audience videos near your camera
* Use full screen (Play, CTRL- F11, look in view menu for "Full screen" or otherwise make the slide as big as possible)


## Timing: 15 minutes per speaker 
* 1 minute to setup
* 4-5 minutes presentation (link for options)
** Use short presentation "Style" (below)
** Pay attention to "Delivery" (below)
** Don't forget your summary
* 1-2 minute questions and feedback 
** Questions from audience if something not clear
** Feedback: [[Style - give good feedback]]
* 5-6 minute discussion (if presentation short, discuss for longer)
** Presenter ask FIRST discussion question
** Audience
*** ANSWER the discussion question. 
*** ADD a detail (who what where why when)
*** PASS the conversation to another group member ("How about you Daiki?")
** Audience silent? Presenter - get people talking ("How about you Daiki?")

## Voice/Non Verbal Delivery - this will be graded
In Zoom presentations, no gestures 
* Eye contact
** Speak at the camera, not your notes. Look down, read, look up and speak
** Put notes down in front of camera (e.g. on keyboard) not to the side. 
* Voice
** try to speak in phrases, fewer hesitations
** Interesting voice!
** Don't make a script and read it - makes your voice boring


## Style for a short presentation
* Hello, my name is NAME.
* Today, I'm going to tell you about TOPIC.
* I will talk about these things (SHOWING YOUR BACKGROUND SLIDE)
* To begin with, SLIDE TITLE 1.  
* Next, SLIDE TITLE 2.  
* Finally, SLIDE TITLE 3.  
* In summary, in this talk the speaker talked about X. However/For example the article Y
* Thank you for listening. Any questions?
