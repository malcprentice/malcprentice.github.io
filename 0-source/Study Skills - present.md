Maybe you have given presentations before
* a school speech contest
* a 45s TOEFL presentation

We are NOT doing that style. We practice semi-formal business/academic style
* notes in one hand (rr, logs, research notes)
* small gestures for emphasis 
* no script
* no podium
* sometimes poster or powerpoint


# Overview 
1) You will research something: [[Index - Invention]]
2) You will organise your ideas clearly [[Index - Arrangement]]
3) You will use clear English [[Index - Style]]
4) You will use notes and memory together ("Memory")
* for logs, handwriting notes OK
* for RR, type an [[Projects - outline]], 
* for advanced and 2nd years, either
** [[Study Skills - make a powerpoint slideshow]]
** [[Study Skills - make a poster]]
5) You will practice eye contact, body language, and voice ("Delivery")
6) You will answer questions
7) You will get feedback
8) You will lead a short discussion after 
9) You _might_ make a powerpoint slideshow

# Assessment


* For RR, I will use the [[Resources - marking rubric for RR report]]. 
* For Posters I will use the [[Resources - marking rubric for poster]]
* For presentations, I will give a global grade based on the [[Resources - marking rubric for presentation]]

If you are using Powerpoint:
* Email me a PPT or PPTX file at least a day before class. 
* No thumbdrives! 
* Name your file properly e.g. "Hiroko Sato-SSGB-Pres1.ppt"


# Arrangement
* RR based: 
** follow the RR templates. 
** Just start "I read/listened to + TITLE"
* Project based
** see the example PPT templates
** Your thesis statement becomes sections
** Your paragraph keywords become slide titles. 
** Your points become slide bullet points. 

# Style
For Style, see [[Style - give a clear presentation]]


# Memory
* Scripts: Make your voice boring, ruins eye contact
* Memorize: Not usually used or possible in real world 
* Notes: In real world (business, academic), people read from notes
** Keywords, not sentences
** Small notes (index cards) let you move both hands (don't shrink the font to fit though)
** Big notes (A4) - keep yout note hand still
** Powerpoint “Speaker View” is usually a bad idea


# Delivery
For slide delivery, see: 
* [[Study Skills - make a powerpoint slideshow]]
* [[Study Skills - make a poster]]

### Remember there is more than one kind of delivery:

# After the talk: Questions 
First, ask questions for meaning
* Anything you don’t understand
* Anything you want to know more about.
* Do NOT ask these boring, generic questions
** “Do you like X?”
** “What do you think about X?”
** “Why did you choose this topic?”

### For graded talks, every listener must ask one question
* Can't (because you weren't listening)? = minus points.
* Stay awake! Take notes!

### Speakers
* Was the question too quiet for everyone to hear?
** repeat it louder
** “The question is …..”
* Keep speaking to everyone, not just the asker
* You are STILL BEING JUDGED ON DELIVERY
* If you don’t know, 
** it's ok!
** say “I will get back to you on that”
* Silence? 
** If no-one asks, start yourself 
** ("One question I’m often asked is…”)
* Check: “Did that answer your question?”

### Speakers: Control interruptions
* I’ll come back to that later.
* I’ll answer that in a moment
* I’ll come to that in a minute
* If you could hold any questions for the end


# After the talk: Feedback 
See [[Style - give good feedback]]

# Handouts (optional)
* Make a handout for the audience by printing your slides. 
Double check your font size
there are many options (every slide, key slides, key slides with notes)
