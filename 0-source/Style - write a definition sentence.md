The category of your topic (a "classification"), and one unique feature.

# When to use a definition
* The topic sentence of a description paragraph
* The general background of an essay
* If you use terms in a special way
* If you are using a normal word in a special sense
Happiness		|is defined here as 	|the emotional state which results from eating chocolate
Happiness 		|is here used to mean 	|a score of 5 or higher	on the self-assessment Satisfaction scale
Happiness 		|is operationalised as 	|balance between positive and negative emotion (Ryff, 1989)


# Think of it as a reverse quiz question:
### A quiz quesion has ONLY ONE possible answer
*  __Bad Question:__ What is a soft drink made with hot water?
*  __Answer:__ Um... Tea? Coffee? Hot lemon? 
*  __Good Question:__ What is a soft drink made from the leaves of Camellia Sinensis?
*  __Answer:__ Tea

### A good definition defines ONLY ONE thing
*  "Tea is a soft drink made with hot water." is not good 
* "Tea is a soft drink made from the leaves of Camellia Sinensis."

### Want more examples?
Look at the first sentence of any Wikipedia article - it is a definition.

topic 			|+ BE 				|CATEGORY 				|CONNECT 				|UNIQUE POINT
----------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------

Paper 			|is a 				|thin material 			|produced by 			|pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp
Economics 		|is the 			|social science 		|that 					|describes the factors that determine the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services.

* Not all Wikipedia articles give a category
* Some give the detail in a separate sentence.





## Tips
1) "Define" does not mean "copy a definition from a dictionary". Do you own research if you have to, and write your OWN definition.
2) Don't define in a boring way. We know what gold is. We know what paper is. Your unique detail must be something we don't know.
