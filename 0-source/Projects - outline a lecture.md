# Aim
In this report, we will practice listening to a short interesting online lecture
* Finding one
* preparing to listen
* knowing what to listen for
* taking notes
* sharing and discussing the topic with a partner



# Instructions for RR outline one TED Talk
## 1) Visit the TED website https://www.ted.com/talks
* Select the option for a short talk (no more than 12 mins)
* Select a topic (e.g. Technology, Education)
* Look for an interesting title
* Watch 20 seconds. If they speak too fast or have a difficult accent, choose again.

## 2) When you have chosen a talk
* Look at the general tips below first on how to prepare.
* Listen to the first minute. If it's too difficult, find something else or slow it down. Start again
* Listen to it once, English only.
* Too difficult?
** If necessary, listen to it again, with English subtitles or transcript if available.
** If you are still lost, either choose a different lecture or use translation if available
** If you have used translation/subtitles/transcript, listen ONE MORE time without them.

## 3) Follow general RR outline instructions
* General Instructions are here: [[Projects - outline]]
* References for a TED video is here: [[Invention - use APA format in reference lists]]
* APA for your Summary is here: [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]

## Bored of TED?
* Look for MOOC or lecture sites under [[Resources - websites for listening]]


# General tips for listening to lectures
## Tips for listening to a lecture
* Prepare:
** Read the description and the titles.
** Try to guess what the speaker will say
** Review what you already know about the topic - read your notes or just think
** If you have time, read something about the topic, and learn any special vocabulary.
** If you will have time later and it is important, record the talk on your phone


## What to listen for.
You do not usually quote lectures, so you do not need to copy every word.
* Instead, use lectures to FIND and ORGANISE ideas. Listen for:
* Important links between things.
* Important agreements/disagreements
* Which ideas are old, and which are new
* The lecturer’s attitude to a topic.  (You can disagree, but don’t ignore)
* Structure words so you know where you are in the lecture or if you have missed something
** First/Next/Finally/In conclusion/Last
** There are three reasons - A, B, and C
** Firstly, A
* Important causes and effects
** X is a result of Y
** Y, because X
** X causes Y
* Rhetorical question answers. Usually happens just before summary or overview. After phrases like:
** So, what happens when ....
** Now, what do we know about X?  Well.....
** So, what would be an example of X?  One example would be...
** What did we learn today? Well,...\
* Important TERMS and DEFINITIONS - write as X = Y
** X means DEFINITION
** X, which is DEFINITION
** X, that is when DEFINITION
** X, also called Y
* Examples - write as “e.g.”
** For example
** A second example is
** For instance
* Summaries
** 	The central/main/key point is
** 	In conclusion / To conclude
** 	What this means is...
* Important Authors / Books / Articles you should read next
** You should read
** You have to look at
* Homework!
** You need to write
** Read / Look at / Write

## Taking notes on lectures
* Lectures are too fast and too hard to take 100% English notes
** Copy only short quotes in English.
** Take most notes as summary (paraphrase) in Japanese
** For your RR outline, type up your notes IN ENGLISH
** For reading log, handwritten Japanese/English notes are OK, but you will present IN ENGLISH, so take a note of any English words you will need
* Lectures are fast - use short-cuts when writing common words. For example
	"is" 		|	=
	"is not"	|	≠
	"causes"	|	--->
	"number"	|	# 
	"and"		|	+ 

## Mind maps or Outlines?
Outlines are better for reading.	|Maps are better for lectures,
Outlines are easy when you type.	|Maps are easier when you hand-write
Outlines are good for organised information ///lectures are usually not organised |Maps are better with disorganised informtion ///e.g. if the speaker keeps switching topics
Outlines are also for PLANNING essays.	|Maps are also good for GETTING IDEAS for essays

## OPTION: Try "Cornell" style
1) Draw the lines as shown (You can buy Cornell notebooks in Loft, there is a template in my folder)
2) Take notes in the right hand box
3) After class/lecture, write keywords to the left
4) After class lecture, write a summary in the middle
5) For my class, dont forget questions +  APA (add them to the summary box.
6) Review: cover the middle and try to remember using the left column
