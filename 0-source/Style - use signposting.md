Signposting says where you are in the essay, and what part of the essay you are talking about. 

|Where is this paragraph in the outline (topic sentence) |"This paragraph looks at..."
|Where did I come from?                                  |"The previous paragraph looked at..."
|Where am I going?                                       |"The next paragraph"
|Which point am I at?                                    |"The second problem is..."
|Which way is your problems section?                     |"As the problems section below will show..."


# Basic signposting for short essays
    * Firstly, KEYWORD.
    * The second theme/point/problem/solution/reason is KEYWORD.
    * The third theme/point/problem/solution/reason is  KEYWORD.
    * This brings us to the third theme, KEYWORD.



# Signposting BACK and FORWARD
Back and forward uses the same phrases.
* Change "above" for "below"
* Change "next" for "previous"
* Change past tense to present or future

|The                         |previous   |section        |described X.
|The                         |next       |section        |describes/will describe X.
|In the                      |previous   |paragraph      |, it was shown that X.
|In the                      |next       |paragraph      |, it will be shown that X.
|As the                      |previous   |chapter        |showed, X.
|As the                      |next       |chapter        |shows, X.
|As shown in the             |previous   |section        |, X.

|As will be mentioned below  |           |               |, X.
|As mentioned above          |           |               |, X.

|This section has described X.       |The next section looks at
|The previous section described X.   |This section instead looks at
|The next section will describe X.   |First, however, this section will examine


# Signposting a section number
* Longer essays/dissertations have section and chapter numbers you can use
* A common mistake, though, is to change the number without changing the reference.
* Be careful!

|The impact of X on Y is covered     |in section 3.4.
|This will be returned to            |below in section 3.2
|More about X is given               |in section 2.4.
