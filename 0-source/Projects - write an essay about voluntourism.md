Why? Where? When? Who with? Doing what?

## Listening
*Listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYWl6Wz2NB8

*SHare your notes with a partner. Do you have the same keywords?

### Quiz for listening

# Essay project
You are going to critically analyse a volunteer opportunity.

## 1) Download the examples and templates
Example essay is on website: [[Examples - example criteria analysis one thing volunteer essay]]
Use the SECTIONAL essay template in the shared materials folder. 

## 2) Read them

## 3) Choose ONE volunteer organisation to analyse. 
*Please choose something outside Japan. 
*Please choose a specific project a student could volunteer on (i.e not something you need to be a doctor for)
*For ideas, try:
**SUJ volunteer website: http://www.soka.ac.jp/sp/international/outbound/program/volunteer/
**Global Festa: https://www.facebook.com/globalfesta2014
**Idealist: http://idealist.org


###  <red>VERY IMPORTANT</red>
It is sometimes hard to tell the difference between 
*actual volunteer organisations
*travel agencies specialising in volunteering e.g. https://www.lovevolunteers.org or https://www.eliabroad.org
*search engines specialising in volunteering e.g. https://www.volunteerworld.com

### For example:
*1) Travel Agency 1 is offering a project helping animals in Argentina: https://www.eliabroad.org/argentina-volunteer
*2) Travel Agency 2 is offering a projec helpinng animals in Argentina: https://www.lovevolunteers.org/destinations/volunteer-argentina/animal-rescue-buenos-aires
*3) Search Engine 1 finds a project helping animals in Argentina: https://www.volunteerworld.com/en/filter?f%5BcC%5D=032&f%5BsCN%5D=Street+Animals

This is the SAME project and it is run by NEITHER of these agencies. They each take a fee ($2-300) for placing volunteers. 
This is not necessarily a bad thing - small projects do not always have the budget for advertisng, websites, recruitment. 
However, just like volunteer projects, not all volunteer travel agencies are good. You can do an essay on one, but your criteria will be different.

### A metaphor
This confuses everyone in class when I try to explain it. But just imagine you want to fly to London:
1) You go to Kayak, a Search Engine: https://www.kayak.co.jp/flights/TYO-LON/2018-11-09/2018-11-23?sort=bestflight_a
2) Kayak tells you the best time/price is from JTB, a travel agency. You go to JTB
3) JTB books the ticket for you, but the flight is actually with ANA.

### Here is how to tell:
*Does your website have 2000 projects in 54 countries? Probably a travel agency
*Do they have TWO costs (a "fee" of 2-300 dollars plus a program fee)? Probably a travel agency.
*Does your website list the name of other groups  and agencies? Probably a search engine

### My recommendation
*Choose an actual project- a organisation with a small number of projects in ONE country or a limited area
*If it is a large organisation, just choose ONE of their projects
*DO NOT choose a search engine. Just use it to find projects

You CAN choose a travel agency, as there are good ones and bad ones, but your criteria need to change. See below: 
*Transparency - is it clear that they are a for-profit taking a fee to place people, and what they use their fee on.
*Travel agencies are not directly responsible for research, sustainability, leading volunteers. 
*They are only responsible for CHOOSING projects/people responsibly and carefully before allowing them on teir list of projects
*Travel agencies criteria (what they are responsible for) are for example:
**Choosing and/or preparing volunteers well 
***A bad agency has no requirements (anyone can volunteer with no training or qualifications) 
***A bad agency has no background checks, even if the project works with children.
***A bad agency has no training or pre-trip education except maybe a pamphlet. 
**Choosing and monitoring projects well
***A bad agency has no criteria of their own (transparency, sustaiability, impact) for choosing which projecs they have on their site (e.g. Cambodian orphanages fine)
***A bad agency has no process for regular checks on the project
**Own transparency
***is it clear how they use those fees they collect? 
***Is the description of each project true and clear? 
***Is it clear they are a for-profit travel agency? Or are they pretending to be an NGO travel agency. 


## 4) Choose three important criteria (traits)
*Look at your notes on the "traits" article (use your own ideas too).
*What do you need to check before choosing a volunteer opportunity?
*Criteria need to match your organisation type (education volunteering and health volunteering are different)
*Make sure your criteria are MEASURABLE. You need to tell me if the group is good or bad and why.

### Your essay will ask you to
1) Define the criteria (e.g. what is sustainability)
2) WHy is it important? 
*EITHER A specific example of an organisation that did not meet that criteria sustainability and why that was bad
*OR a cause-effect sentence "If an organisaton is not sustainable, then X will happen")
3) How can I check it (Don't just say "check the website" - check WHICH website look WHERE look for WHAT )


## 5) Start research on your organisation.
*Read their website
*Google "Review"+their name
*Read about them on other websites reviewing charities and NGOs.
*International groups:
**Check their review on Charity Navigator: http://www.charitynavigator.org/
**Check for a review on GuideStar: http://www.guidestar.org

## 6) Start putting your research into the template outline

# Style
*Watch the plural - one criterION, two criteriA
*Be careful of your main vocab word - volunteer
**A volunteer, two volunteers. Volunteers are people!
**When talking about the topic, use "this volunteer organisation" or "experience" or "project"
**Voluntourism is a BAD thing, from the TED video.
*Your criteria are suggestions and processes (check X, shuold check X. In order to do this fiurst check X then Y.)
*ANALYSIS DETAILS ARE PAST TENSE RESEARCH FINDINGS ("I found out that they do not show financial info")
*Some phrases for anlaysis
**the X was (not) available / very detailed
**Y could not not be confirmed /
**their website (did not) show Z
