## What is "Incomplete"?
I can't give "I" without an official certificate and form.
It's not for when you miss the vocab test because you slept in. Set two alarms!
It's not for when you haven't finished your QW on the last day. Do your QW earlier in term!
Even if you get "I", it's just a delay - you still need to submit missing work by the beginning of the following term.

To get a temporary "I" send me an email, followed as soon as you can by:
Injury or sickness      |Medical Certificate from doctor
Accident                |Certificate of accident
Disaster                |Certificate of disaster.
University-approved Study abroad |Documents to certify studying abroad
Other                   |Note from your Dean
