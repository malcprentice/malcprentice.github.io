# What is Cohesion?
_Cohesion_ is when you use special English phrases to tell me:
* Where I am in the essay outline ("Signposting")
    * e.g. "The first problem is", "As the previous noted,"
    * See [[Style - use signposting]] for more
* What each sentence does ("Signalling")

### This page is about signalling:
|This an example sentence            |"For example, ..."
|This is another example             |"A second example of this would be..."
|This an effect                      |"This is because..."
|This a disagreeing response         |"However, ..."
|THis is an agreeing response        |"In fact, ..."
|This a another supporting point     |"Additionally, ..."
|This is a summary                   |"In summary, ..."
|This is a new reason on same topic  |"Another reason X is a problem  is that"


# Basics: So, Or, But, Because, And
You could write an essay with just these (a boring one though).
* cats, so
* cats, and
* cats, but
* cats, or

Use them correctly! They JOIN sentences. Never do this:
*  ~~cats. So~~
*  ~~cats. And~~
*  ~~cats. But~~
*  ~~cats. Or~~

Because works both ways, but be careful of the order
* Because X, Y.
* Y, because X.

# Giving an example (alternatives to "for example")
* For example, X
* X, for example Y, Z
* An example of this is X
* X such as Y
* For instance, X
* As an example, X.
* One example of this is X
* Namely, X.
* Chiefly, X



# Adding another point: (alternatives to "Also")
* In addition, X.
* Additionally, X
* Moreover, X.
* What is more, X.
* Furthermore, X.
* Another X is.
* Also, X

# Adding a detail to a point
* In fact, 
* Specifically, 
* To be specific, X.
* In particular, X



# Adding a clarification
* In other words
* Another way of understanding this is
* To put it differently
* To put it another way
* That is to say
* To repeat,


# Giving a reason (alternatives to "so")
* X, so Y
* Y because X
* X. Therefore Y.

|Around          |10%        |of Y are Z.
|More than       |7000       |of Y are not Z.
|Less than       |five       |of those Y are Z.
|Approximately   |half       |Ys are Z.
|Up to           |one third  |of Y could be Z.
