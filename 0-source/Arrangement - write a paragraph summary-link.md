The last sentence of every paragraph should be either:
* a summary (e.g. "In summary...")
* a link (e.g. "The next paragraph...")
* both (e.g. "In summary....The next paragraph...")
* neither (introductions paragraph, or longer essays)
** if you have 10 paragraphs in one section of one chapter of your dissertation, don't summarise every paragraph! 
** That isn't true in this class though. Let's practice summaries and links!

|Paragraph                                                       |Link, summary, both,or neither ?
|Introduction                                                    |Neither - [[Arrangement - write an introduction thesis statement]]
|Description paragraph                                           |Link only///Description sentences are all different, hard to summarise
|Problems paragraphs (normal body paragraph                      |Both
|Solutions paragraph (last body paragraph)                       |Summary only///Next paragraph is last =  obviously conclusion = no need to link
|Conclusion paragraph                                            |Neither - [[Style - write a final comment sentence]]
|Paragraph X of a longer essay                                   |Up to you///Does the reader need a summary yet? ///Is the topic about to change?

# Rules for sectional essays
* Once you have more than 5 paragraphs, the rules change. 
* See [[Arrangement - write a sectional essay]] for details
* In summary, though, you can: 
** have a separate conclusion paragraph for the section
** just glue 3 sentences to the end of the last section body paragraph:

## If you DO NOT use a section conclusion paragraph
The last three sentences of the last paragraph in the section:
* <red>summarize the last paragraph in the section</red>
* <green>summarize the section<green?
* <blue>link
** link to the next SECTION, not the next paragraph
** don't link into the conclusion section</blue>
* e.g. <red>"In summary, the problem of heavy metal pollution is serious, both for miners and people living near the mine.</red> <green>Overall, __this section__ has shown that production of X causes a number of issues - A, B, and C - of which the most effective is C.</green> <blue>However, the next paragraph examines some possible solutions to these issues"</blue>


## If you DO use a section conclusion paragraph
Body paragraphs are normal
Section Conclusion paragraphs should have:
* Topic sentence for section conclusion e.g. "In summary, this section looked at..."
* Summary of each paragraph in the section (1-3 sentences)
* Final Comment for section (optional)
* Link to next SECTION.
