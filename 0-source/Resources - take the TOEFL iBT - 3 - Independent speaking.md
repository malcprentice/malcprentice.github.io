# Overview and Tips
1) You only have 15s to prepare. Jot down some ideas.
2) Speak for the full 45s  
* There will be a timer in the title bar.
* Practice with your phone
3) Do not give an outline (I have two reasons, X and Y).
* Most example answers do not include one, and it takes too much time.
* Focus on content and transitions.
4) This is a speaking test - use informal speech.
* Especially, use contractions (it’s, they’re)
* Example responses avoid formal signalling like “In summary” - these are for writing
5) Practice using the right tense, conditionals
* Do you prefer  =   I prefer
* Would you prefer   =   I would prefer
* Why did you X  =   I Xed because
* Why are you Xing?  =   I am Xing because next year I will Y
6) Study Tips for all speaking (independent AND integrated)
* Record yourself speaking.
    * Transcribe yourself and look for problems
    * Do the same speech again and again - faster and smoother
* See http://www.ets.org/s/toefl for example answers
* Don’t repeat to fill time
    * add something
    * Practice filling the time until you get it right
