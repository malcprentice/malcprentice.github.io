How handle mixed level classes:
1) Peer Teaching (have upper level teach/help lower levels) but not too much or too often - it get boring for them. 
2) Prepare survival sheets for the lower level to help them keep up
3) Prepare a worksheet for upper levels to work on while you are doing the Presentation/Practice sections with lower levels. 
4) If it happens a lot, split your sections in two
    * 45 minutes lower level intro with a focus on presentation/practice. If upper levels are bored, tough. 
    * 45 mins upper level with a focus on practice/performance. If lower levels find it challenging, good.
