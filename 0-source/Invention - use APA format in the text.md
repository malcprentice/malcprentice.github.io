# Pattern 1: APA brackets style (recommended)
A book 							|name and year	 			|(Smith, 2015)
A newspaper 					|name, year, month+date 	|(Smith, 2015, April 2)
No date?	 					|use n.d. 					|(Smith, n.d.)
No author? 						|use the title in quotes///comma goes __inside__ the quotes  	|("Title," 2015, April 2)
No author or date? 				|Title + n.d. 				|("Title," n.d.)
2 authors? 						|use "&" 					|(Smith & Jones, 2015)
3-4 authors? 					|use commas + &  			|(Smith, Jones, & Suzuki, 2015) 
want to give a page number? 	|use p.						|(Smith, 2008, p. 56)
2+ sources?         			|use semicolon (;)				|(Smith, 2003; Ellis, 2004)

# Other patterns
Pattern 1 above (brackets) is easiest
*It works for all kinds of sources, even titles
*You don't need to write the sentence in a special way
*It's easy to give more than one source
However, it is good style to vary your pattern
*Suzuki (2001) said that something is something.
*According to Suzuki (2010), something is something.
Remember, though:
*You can ONLY use this with NAMES - for titles, use pattern 1
*It's easier to comment on the source (what was the method, is it a good source)


## Pattern 2: NVF (Name-Verb-Finding)
Name 					|Verb 			|Finding
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------
Smith (1999)			|stated (that)	|X is Y
Smith (1999, p. 31)		|found (that)	|not all X are Y
Smith and Jones (2001)	|noted (that)	|"QUOTE"


## Pattern 3: PNVCF (Preposition-Name-Verb-Comma-Finding)
Preposition		|Name						|Verb		|Finding
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------|--------
As				|Smith (1999)				|stated 	|, X is Y
				|Smith (1999, p. 31)		|found 		|, not all X are Y
				|Smith and Jones (2001)		|noted		|, "QUOTE"

## Pattern4: INCF (Intro-Name-Comma-Finding)
Intro			|Name WITH COMMA			|Finding
---------------	|---------------------------|--------
According to	|Smith (1999),				| X is Y
In the words of	|Smith (1999, p. 31),		| not all X are Y
To quote		|Smith and Jones (2001),	| "QUOTE"

## Pattern 5: SNVF (Source Type - Name - Verb - Finding)
Source Type				|Name						|Verb (that) 	|Finding
-----------------------	|---------------------------|---------------|--------
An article by			|Smith (1999)				|stated (that)	| X is Y
A report by				|Smith (1999, p. 31)		|found (that)	| not all X are Y
A survey conducted by	|Smith and Jones (2001)		|noted (that)	| "QUOTE"
An interview study by 	|



## Pattern 6: NMVF (Name - Method - Verb - Finding)
Source Type				|Method											|Verb + that 	|Finding
-----------------------	|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------
Smith (1999)			|, having interviewed 12 university students, 	|said that		| X is Y
Smith (1999, p. 31)		|, in a review of the literature on  dyslexia, 	|found that 	| not all X are Y
Smith and Jones (2001)	|, using a survey of 134 High school students, 	|noted that		| "QUOTE"

## Pattern 7: Inserted method
You can also insert methods into other sentences. See [[Style - use a parenthetical statement]]
*For example, pattern 2 with inserted method
**Smith (1999) found, using a survey of 134 High school students, that X is Y
**Smith (1999) discovered, using a autobiographical diary study, that X is Y
**Smith (1999) surveyed 230 University student, and discovered that X is Y
*For example, using "and" or "ing"
**Smith (1999) did an interview study, and found that X is Y
**Smith (1999) did an interview study, find _ing_ that X is Y

## Pattern 8: Block quote
__For quotes longer than 40 words__
Blockquotes should be
*indented
*with one line space before and after
*have no quotes
*citation in brackets at end of last line

<blue>
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
<green>
>>I noticed in the Chinese class that when we did have a pause...I was very relieved to have a little break. If I hadn’t noticed that, I would have carried on worrying about pauses in my own teaching. (Lowe, 1987, p. 93)

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

# Common mistakes
### Comma INSIDE the quotemarks</red>
*Good: ("Title," n.d.)
*Bad: ("Title", n.d.)
*Also bad ("Title" n.d.)

### No title case. 
99% of your re


### Use "and" outside brackets. Use "&" inside brackets__
*Something is something (Suzuki __&__ Smith, 2010).
*Suzuki __and__ Smith (2010) said something is something.
*According to Suzuki __and__ Smith (2010), something is something.

### Newspapers and Websites need full date
*Something is something (Suzuki, 2013, September 30).
*Suzuki (2013, September 30) says something is something.
*According to Suzuki (2013, April 16), something is something.
 
### If there is no author, use the PAGE title, not the website title!
**Websites are libraries. You never cite the library
**However, IF the website is an _organisation_ AND is the author, you can use its name.
**For example on the UNICEF website:
***UNICEF is the author of official annual report. Use (UNICEF, 2013, April 3)
***UNICEF is NOT the author of every article in the blog section. Use ("Title of article," 2013, April 3)
**<red> Use inside brackets style ONLY!</red> - no "According to" or "says" if there is no person's name

### Only give a few words of the title
Too long: ("The impact of global warming on river dolphins in the Amazon," n.d.)
*You're just trying to help them find the full source in your Reference list. A few words is enough
*Try ("The impact of global warming," n.d.)
*Or even ("The impact," n.d.)
*Give the full title in the references, though:
<ref>
_The impact of global warming on river dolphins in the Amazon._ (n.d.). Retrieved from http://fake.com/fake.html
</ref>
