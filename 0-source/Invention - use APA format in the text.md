# In text citations
## Pattern 1 - brackets - recommended!

|A book 						|name and year	 			|(Smith, 2015)
|A newspaper 					|name, year, month+ date 	|(Smith, 2015, April 2)
|No date?	 					|use n.d. 					|(Smith, n.d.)
|No author? 					|use the title              |("Title," 2015, April 2)
|No author, Japanes title?      |use romaji                 |("Romaji no daimei," 2015, April 2)
|No author or date? 			|Title +  n.d. 				|("Title," n.d.)
|2 authors? 					|use "&" 					|(Smith & Jones, 2015)
|3+ authors? 					|use "et al."			    |(Smith et al. 2015) 
|want to give a page number? 	|use p.						|(Smith, 2008, p. 56)
|2+ sources for same sentence?  |use semicolon (;)		    |(Smith, 2003; Ellis, 2004)
|2+ sources with same name/date |use a b                    |Blah (Suzuki, 2010a) blah (Suzuki, 2010b)
|2+ sources with same name/no date |use underscore ab       |Blah (Suzuki, n.d._a) blah (Suzuki, n.d._b)


This is the ONLY pattern you can use if there is not author, since __According to "Title," n.d., penguins__ is confusing
This is the EASIEST method to use with multiple sources
However, other patterns are sometimes better style. Try: 

## Pattern 2: NVF (Name-Verb-Finding)
|Name 					|Verb 			|Finding
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------
|Smith (1999)			|stated (that)	|X is Y
|Smith (1999, p. 31)	|found (that)	|not all X are Y
|Smith and Jones (2001)	|noted (that)	|"QUOTE"


## Pattern 3: PNVCF (Preposition-Name-Verb-Comma-Finding)
|Preposition		|Name						|Verb		|Finding
|---------------|---------------------------|-----------|--------
|As				|Smith (1999)				|stated 	|, X is Y
|				|Smith (1999, p. 31)		|found 		|, not all X are Y
|				|Smith and Jones (2001)		|noted		|, "QUOTE"

## Pattern4: INCF (Intro-Name-Comma-Finding)
|Intro			|Name WITH COMMA			|Finding
|---------------	|---------------------------|--------
|According to	|Smith (1999),				| X is Y
|In the words of	|Smith (1999, p. 31),		| not all X are Y
|To quote		|Smith and Jones (2001),	| "QUOTE"

## Pattern 5: SNVF (Source Type - Name - Verb - Finding)
|Source Type				|Name						|Verb (that) 	|Finding
|-----------------------	|---------------------------|---------------|--------
|An article by			|Smith (1999)				|stated (that)	| X is Y
|A report by				|Smith (1999, p. 31)		|found (that)	| not all X are Y
|A survey conducted by	|Smith and Jones (2001)		|noted (that)	| "QUOTE"
|An interview study by 	|



## Pattern 6: NMVF (Name - Method - Verb - Finding)
|Source Type				|Method											|Verb +  that 	|Finding
|-----------------------	|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|--------
|Smith (1999)			|, having interviewed 12 university students, 	|said that		| X is Y
|Smith (1999, p. 31)		|, in a review of the literature on  dyslexia, 	|found that 	| not all X are Y
|Smith and Jones (2001)	|, using a survey of 134 High school students, 	|noted that		| "QUOTE"

## Pattern 7: Inserted method
You can also insert methods into other sentences. See [[Style - use a parenthetical statement]]
* For example, pattern 2 with inserted method
    * Smith (1999) found, using a survey of 134 High school students, that X is Y
    * Smith (1999) discovered, using a autobiographical diary study, that X is Y
    * Smith (1999) surveyed 230 University student, and discovered that X is Y
* For example, using "and" or "ing"
    * Smith (1999) did an interview study, and found that X is Y
    * Smith (1999) did an interview study, find _ing_ that X is Y

## Pattern 8: Block quote
__For quotes longer than 40 words__
Blockquotes should be
* indented
* with one line space before and after
* have no quotes
* citation in brackets at end of last line

<blue>
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
<green>
>I noticed in the Chinese class that when we did have a pause...I was very relieved to have a little break. If I hadn’t noticed that, I would have carried on worrying about pauses in my own teaching. (Lowe, 1987, p. 93)
</green>
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

# Tips and Common Mistakes for in-text citations
## Comma INSIDE the quotemarks</red>
* Good: ("Title," n.d.)
* Bad: ("Title", n.d.)
* Also bad ("Title" n.d.)

## No title case unless it is a COLLECTION
* NEver for article names or web page names. 
* Always for Magazine names, Newspaper names, Video collection names (TED Talks)
* Sometimes for books, but only if the COLLECT the work of multiple authors. So not for Harry Potter, for example, which is only one author. 
* Some websites are hard to tell if they are collections (BBC News) or just websites. As a guide
    * Cite it as news/magazine if you see subscriptions "Buy this month's issue" 
    * Look it up on wikipedia. Is it called a newspaper?

## Other verbs
Bored of "said", "found" and "noted"? Choose another!
See [[Style - use verbs for citation]]

### What is there is more than one author
This changed in 2020. Use APA7 unless told otherwise. 
* APA6: Chocolate is great (Smith, Suzuki, & Jones, 2010) 
* APA7: Chocolate is great (Smith et al. 2010) 
* APA6: Smith, Suzuki, and Jones (2010) say that English is great.
* APA7: Smith et al. (2010) say that English is great. 

In references
APA6: Give seven authors: first 6 and last authors in references:
* 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... 20. NO "&".
* <ref>First, F., Second, S., Third, T, Fourth, F., Fifth, F., Sixth, S., ... Last, L. (2013). </ref>

APA7: Same as APA6, but give first 19. 



Just in case you need it, APA6 was more complicated:
|2 authors      |cite both EVERY TIME                           |(First & Second, 2013)
|3-5 authors    |cite in normal way the FIRST TIME              |(First, Second, Third, Fourth, & Fifth, 2013)
|3-5 authors    |use short "et al." version SECOND TIME ONWARDS |(First et al., 2013)
|6+  authors     |use short version EVERY TIME                   |(First et al., 2013)


<red>Careful!</red> ("et al<red>.</red>", not "et al")
 
## What if I used a quote?
Direct quotes (" ") from a book need the page number
* "Something something" (Suzuki, 2002, p.23)
* Suzuki (2002, p.23) says "something something".
* According to Suzuki (2013, April 16), "something something is something".

## What if I have more than one source for a fact?
Separate with semicolons 1; 2; 3; 4
* (Smith, 2003)
* (Smith, 2003; Ellis & Jones, 2004)
* (Smith, 2003; Ellis & Jones, 2004; "Title 1," 2003)
* (Smith, 2003; Ellis & Jones, 2004; "Title 1," 2003; "Title 2," 2004)

### Which tense should I use?
Usually, use past tense - the article/research is done
* As Smith (1999) noted, X is Y               (Smith finished writing
* Smith (1999) interviewed 10 JHS students    (Smith finished interviewing)

But to emphasize it is ALWAYS true, STILL important, or NOT finished:
* As Smith (1999, p.32) noted, cats do not speak English
* As Smith (1999) has noted, X is Y
* All research so far has found that X is Y
* Data collected in this pilot project has shown X. Next, Y

## When do I use "&" or "and"?
|Use "&"  INSIDE brackets.      |Chocolate is great (Smith & Jones, 2010)
|Use "and" OUTSIDE brackets     |Smith and Jones (2010) say that chocolate is great.



Don't forget - references section always uses "&" even outside brackets. 
<ref>Smith, M., Suzuki, K., & Jones. P. (2010). _English._ Tokyo: Kodansha.</ref>
Don't forget the last comma: _1, 2<red>,</red> & 3_  not _1, 2 & 3_


### Use "and" outside brackets. Use "&" inside brackets__
* Something is something (Suzuki __&__ Smith, 2010).
* Suzuki __and__ Smith (2010) said something is something.
* According to Suzuki __and__ Smith (2010), something is something.

## Newspapers and Websites need full date
* Something is something (Suzuki, 2013, September 30).
* Suzuki (2013, September 30) says something is something.
* According to Suzuki (2013, April 16), something is something.
 
## If there is no author, use the PAGE title, not the website title!
    * Websites are libraries. You never cite the library
    * However, IF the website is an _organisation_ AND is the author, you can use its name.
    * For example on the UNICEF website:
        * UNICEF is the author of official annual report. Use (UNICEF, 2013, April 3)
        * UNICEF is NOT the author of every article in the blog section. Use ("Title of article," 2013, April 3)
    * <red> Use inside brackets style ONLY!</red> - no "According to" or "says" if there is no person's name

## Only give a few words of the title if it is long
Too long: ("The impact of global warming on river dolphins in the Amazon," n.d.)
* You're just trying to help them find the full source in your Reference list. A few words is enough
* Try ("The impact of global warming," n.d.)
* Or even ("The impact," n.d.)
* Give the full title in the references, though:
<ref>
_The impact of global warming on river dolphins in the Amazon._ (n.d.). Retrieved from http://fake.com/fake.html
</ref>



## WHat if my web page disappears?
This is why you put the "retrieved" date on website references.
Imagine you wanted to cite the front page of this website: http://www.qub.ac.uk/
However, the web page is down, or gone, or changed (which happens a lot with the front page of websites). If you give the date, then

1) Waybackmachine has an archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20160602044625/http://www.qub.ac.uk/
2)  Google Cache also has a version: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:YG-g-gATZgsJ:www.qub.ac.uk/+ &cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=jp

That way people can use the cache or the wayback machine to access it.



# References lists: Issues and tips. 
## Text and references section should match 
* If you have 6 citations in your essay, you need 6 in your references. 
* Names should match
    * Use author name in text, I need to see it in references. 
    * Use title ("Penguins," n.d.) in text ( can be shortened) , I need to see full title under P for Penguin in references

## What if a book has multiple editions?
* e.g. First edition published in 1926, Second edition published ain 1952
* Give the year of the edition you READ. No italics for edition number
<ref>
Smith, J. (2013). _Book Title_ (3rd ed.). Oxford: OUP.
</ref>

## How do volume (issue) numbers work?
* Often one volume = one year
    * Journal of Writing, 3(2)     =   "second issue in the third book"
* If each issue starts on page 1,           there are several "page 23"s in one volume
    * please give the issue number so I can find the correct page
* If each issue continues from the previous,    there is only one "page 23" in each volume
    * do not give the issue number
* Use italics for the thing you hold (see "Common Problem 8 below)
    * You hold the Journal volume, not the issue
    * YES  <em>Journal of Writing, 3</em><blue>(2)</blue>, 23-32
    * NO   <em>Journal of Writing, 3<red>(2)</red></em>, 23-32


 
## What order are the references in?
* Alphabetical order first, then year order
* More than one ref by same author, same year? Add a letter (abc)
<ref>
Aardvark, A. (2012).
_Bananas are great._ (2009, April 17).
Prentice, M. (2003a).
Prentice, M. (2003b).
Prentice, M. (2004).
Question. (n.d.)
UNHCR. (n.d._a)
UNHCR. (n.d._b)
UNHCR. (n.d._c)
Zod, G. (1999).
</ref>



## What if it's an ebook? 
* APA6: Add [Kindle version] in the same place you put [video file] for TED Talks etc, to show it's not paper
* APA7: Don't do above. 
    * Instead, give publisher like a normal book (remember in APA7 there is no city)
    * Suzuki, A. (2010). _Book title._ Kodansha. 


## What's a DOI?
* If the publisher website goes down your http link will break. 
* The idea is that doi "digital object identifier" will change to point to wherever the article is now stored (new publisher, some archive). 
* If available, add it on the end like a http address 
* APA7:  https:/doi.org/10.1111/111-11-123-1234-1
* APA6: Retrieved from doi:/doi.org/10.1111/111-11-123-1234-1

## Do I give the page numbers?
### In the text
* DON’T give page numbers when talking about a whole article/book
* DO give page numbers for a specific fact from a specific page
* DO give page numbers for any quotes (" ")
|Use p for one page                                 |Smith (2010, p.  23)
|Use pp for multiple pages                      |Smith (2010, pp. 25-26)
|If no pages, use shortened subheading          |(Smith, 2010, "Participants")
|If no pages or subheading, use paragraph number |(Smith, 2010, para. 5)

### In the references
|Journal articles       |yes - beginning and end of article
|News Online            |No
|Newspaper articles     |yes - page(s) and section if needed
|Books                  |No
|Edited book chapter    |yes - beginning and end of chapter

## How do I do "Burasage"
* Don't use tab!
* The templates have a "references" style you can use. Just type.
* If it breaks, use the menu
    * format-paragraph-special-hanging
    * (書式-->段落-->最初の行-->ぶら下げ)



## DON'T copy the case of the original
If your book cover  is written "MY DOG" 
* It __doesn't matter!__ Ignore it!
* Write "My dog" (book, article) or My Dog (magazine name)
If your newspaper is written "JAPAN TIMES" or "japantimes"
* It __doesn't matter!__ Ignore it!
* In your references, write "Japan Times"


## What if there is no author?
### In the text
|Anonymous Articles/Chapters/Web    |short title in quotes      |("How to park," 2013, April 1)
|Anonymous Books/Reports (rare)         |short title in italics     |(<em>How to park</em>, 2013)
|Organisation is author? Use that.  |(JAF, 2013)

<red>Organisations are only authors for official reports, not for website pages. </red>

### In the References
|Anonymous Articles/Chapters/Web |full title in italics
|Anonymous Books/Reports (rare)     |full title in italics

# How do I cite Acronyms like "UNESCO" or "SUA"?
|First time     |(United Nations High Commision for Refugees [UNHCR], 2000)
|Second time    |(UNHCR, 2000)

 

# Answer not on this page?
There are LOTS of rules. I can't cover them all in class.
Also, rules change - APA6 to APA7. Maybe your teachers wants MLA. 
So: 
* Search Google (e.g. "How to cite YouTube in APA"). 
* Best websites for clear examples and answers are:
    * Purdue Online: https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl 
    * APA style blog: http://blog.apastyle.org
* For academic referneces, use Google Scholar citation function (but don't trust it). 
* Copy from another article that uses the same or similar source.
* Check the actual APA manual
    * I have one
    * The library has several
    *  http://www.amazon.com/Publication-American-Psychological-Association-Edition/dp/1433805618
* If you can't solve your problem, email me.


# Tools to help you
Now that you can do it manually, try these tools. 
They are useful if 
* you are managing hundreds of references for your thesis
* You have to switch a lot between APA, MLA, etc. 

However <red>they often make mistakes - check carefully</red> 

### Manage references on your computer and on the web
Mendeley: https://www.mendeley.com/
Zotero: https://www.zotero.org/

### Manage sources on the web only
Bibsonomy: http://www.bibsonomy.org/
Citeulike: http://www.citeulike.org/

### Helps you make a citation
Google Scholar:     https://scholar.google.co.jp/ (search, click "Cite" and choose APA)
BibMe:              http://www.bibme.org    (default MLA. Switch to APA!)
