It's hard to hear the difference between "f" and "s" and some other sounds when spelling on the telephone.
Especially for names and addresses, you might need to spell using this system.
So, for example to spell "Hachioji", you would say "Hotel alpha charlie hotel india oscar juliet india"

Alpha 	|Bravo	|Charlie 	|Delta	|Echo	|Foxtrot
Golf 		|Hotel	|India	|Juliet	|Kilo		|Lima
Mike	|November |Oscar	|Papa	|Quebec	|Romeo
Sierra 	|Tango	|Uniform	|Victor	|Whisky
|X-ray	|Yankee	 |Zulu
