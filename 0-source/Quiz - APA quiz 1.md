## Answers
1) No title case in website pages
2) "January 16, 2019, __from__ " - from is in wrong place
3) If you have date in brackets (2017, April 6), you DO NOT need date of download "Retrieved 2019, June 11 from", just "Retrieved from"
4) Neko ga suki reference is missing translation 
* _Neko ga suki_ [I like cats]. 
* Remember that translation is NOT italics, and period goes AFTER the translation
5) Wilson reference is news, and should have source name in italics
* are building Japan's roads and sewers. _Reuters._
* Remember, in news, article title does NOT get italics
6) Mikiko is a first name. Always use surnames.
7) Whole list issue: not alphabetical order. Should be Application-Mikiko-Neko-Wilson.
