## Answers
1) "Application" mistake 1
* No title case in website pages. Title case is for COLLECTIONS (e.g. Newspaper names)
* recognition, not Recognition, etc.

3) "Neko" mistake 1 
* If you have writing date (2017, April 6), you DO NOT need download date 
* Just use "Retrieved from"

4)  "Neko" mistake 2
* Missing translation 
* _Neko ga suki_ [I like cats].

5) Wilson mistake
* Reuters is a famous news service. 
* News should have source name in italics. Article title does NOT get italics

* For less famous sources, it's hard to tell if it is news or a website. If you're not sure, Google it. 
6) "Mikiko" mistake 1
* Mikiko is a first name. Always use surnames.
* e.g. Suzuki, M. 
7) "Mikiko" mistake 2
* Burasage!
