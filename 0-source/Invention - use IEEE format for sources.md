#In-text citation rules
1) Use SQUARE BRACKETS with a number inside [1].
2) Number them in order of use.
3) If you use a citation twice, use the original number
4) If you use more than one source for a fact, use all numbers
*Preferred style is [1], [3], [5]
*However this is also OK: [1, 3, 5]
5) Reference goes BEFORE period [1].
*This is not good. [1]
*This is good [1].
6) Space before the reference
*This is not good[1].
*This is good [1]
7) IF page numbers are necessary, give them like this:
*[3, pp. 5-10]
*[3, Ch. 4, pp. 3-5]
8) You can also refer to specific Sections and Figures
*[3, Fig. 3]
*([3, Sec. 1.2])

#In-text style and examples
###Option 1: Just give the fact and a number
*The snow leopard became endangered in 1967 [1].
*Only 4% of computers produced are ever recycled [1].

###Option 2: Give the citation type
*Several recent studies [3, 4, 15, 16] have shown that
*Most research [3, 4, 15, 16] suggests that

###Option 3: Use the number directly
*For example, see [7]...
*Studies such as [3] show that...

###Option 4: Give the name
DO NOT DO THIS unless the author name is somehow important.
*Even Einstein [2] has argued that.......
*According to Gandhi [3]

#Common Questions
See the examples above for answers:
*What if there are two authors? See [3]
*What if there are more than two authors? See [2]
*What if there is no author? See [5]
*What if there is no date? See [6]

#Suggestion for the future
Numbered systems are really fiddly in long documents. If you delete your first citation, you have to change ALL your numbers. Also, it's easy to use the wrong number and difficult to spot mistakes. If you have to use IEEE for your disseration, use automatic reference management software. I recommend Zotero with a Microsoft Word plugin.
