# Tips
*<red>CAREFUL</red>. You can partition "dogs", but not "Shiba" - start at the right level.
*If your topic has one well-known form (e.g. Gold), normal partition is hard.
**However, you can always find something: 
***conflict Gold and conflict-free Gold
***three main gold-producing areas
*if you want a comment in the same sentence, don't use colons in Option 1/2. They introduce a list, which must finish. 
**Use commas or colons (", of which" " - of which")
**Use a new sentence (". Of these")
*Your teacher might talk about "classification-partition" in the future
**a classification is the first half when you [[Style - write a definition sentence]])
**Careful - it's really hard to write both a partition and a definition/classification
**If you want to define AND partition, go UP a level for your definition: "Tigers are a kind of big cat. There are seven kinds of tiger"*
