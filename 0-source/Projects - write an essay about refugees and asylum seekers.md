# Introduction
>>UNHCR was set up in 1951 to help the estimated 1 million people still uprooted after World War II to return home. Since then, we have helped find durable solutions for tens of millions of refugees ...the number of refugees of concern to UNHCR stood at 10.4 million refugees at the beginning of 2013, down slightly from a year earlier....half in Asia and some 28 per cent in Africa. Source: http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c1d.html

>>The terms asylum-seeker and refugee are often confused: an asylum-seeker is someone who says he or she is a refugee, but whose claim has not yet been definitively evaluated...Those judged through proper procedures not to be refugees, nor to be in need of any other form of international protection, can be sent back to their home countries.

# Invention
Take handwritten notes first. Be ready to present your country next class.

### 1) Get some general background 
Try  the UNHCR website: http://www.unhcr.org/
*e.g. how many refugees/asylum seekers in the world. 
*e.g. how many in Japan? Do you notice anything about the numbers?

### 2) Choose and research one UNHCR emergency area
Choose one of these: http://data.unhcr.org/
Do NOT choose "Mediterranean" (too many countries - makes it impossible to write section 1)
### Follow the essay pattern
*Essay section 1: What happened that your area is producing asyllum seekers and refugees (3 stages OR 3 causes)
*Essay section 2: Refugees in nearby countries
**What problems are there in refugees camps near your area? 
***Common problems include lack of food/water/medicine/education for children/sanitation/overcrowding/disease/recruitment as child soldiers/human trafficking 
***Here are a some example links: http://www.ted.com/talks/barat_ali_batoor_my_desperate_journey_with_a_human_smuggler http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/what-it-s-be-somali-refugee-kenya 
**What solutions?
***Think about both UNHCR more permanent solutions http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646cf8.html
***Also about temporary solutions (mostly NGOs and UN organisations supplying help)
*Essay section 3: Asylum Seekers in Japan
**What problems are there for Asylum Seekers in Japan.
***One set of problems for those in detention center: detention center conditions, violence, lack of access to legal help, communication tools, missing documents
***Another set of problems for those outside detention centers: lack of language skill, money, permission to work, places to sleep, missing documents
