# Warmer Discussion
    Are you doing job hunting? How is it going?
    What part time jobs have you had?
    What job do you want after you graduate?

# Terms
C.V. or Resume? Which is which?
1) A one page summary of work and learning used mostly in US business.
2) A  2-3 page summary of learning and work used in the UK and schools.

# Cover letter?
Usually you don't just send the CV. You send a short letter:
* introducing yourself
* saying how your skills/experience match each point in the job advert
* Any information they asked for which is not on your CV (e.g. interview availability)
* any other highlights you really don't want them to miss on your cv


See [[Examples - example cover letter]]

There are many different styles. 
* UK cover letters tend to be very short (like the example above). 
* US cover letters tend to add more text, about aims/philosophy. 
Make sure you know what style you need and find more examples. 



# Analysing a CV/Resume structure

* What are the sections?
* How are they different?

* What is the first line of the address: country or street?
* What order are jobs/education? Earliest first or latest?
* What information is given for your job / education?
* Is it a good idea to use cute or mobile email addresses (I_eat_penguinfeet@ezweb.ne.jp)
