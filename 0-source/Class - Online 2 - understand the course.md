Read this page in English, but if you get stuck, here is a (bad) translation https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=ja&u=http%3A%2F%2Falba-english.org%2FStudy%2520Skills%2520-%2520basics%2520for%2520online.html 

# Class 2 - Homework 1
* Last class I said "If you have problems, email me, any time!"
* But I didn't tell you how to write an email in English. 
* Read this: [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]]
** Read the example emails you can just copy
** Read "Make your own email" to learn what to do if the example is not enough 
* Homework: 
** Send me a GOOD email in English asking a question. 
** If you're not sure, just copy "Example email 2: Asking for help" 
** I will give you feedback on your email style. 
** I might ask you to send it again if it's not good. 
* After we're on campus, instead of emailin, you can ask in class or come to office hours - check my schedule ( [[Schedules - Malc's schedule]] ) and book an office hour appointment. 

#Class 2 - Homework 2
## Read these important points
* Dont worry about the assessment - I will explain each point, one by one later
