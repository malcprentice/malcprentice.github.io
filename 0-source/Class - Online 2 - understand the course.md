# Homework 1 - Write a good email
* In class 1, I said "If you have problems, email me!"
* But I didn't tell you how to write an email.
* Before next class:
* 1) Read this: [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]]
** Read "Make your own email" and "Common Mistakes"
** There are example emails you can just copy
* 2) Think of a question you want to ask me
** Any question is OK
*** Question about class
*** Question about my country (Scotland)
*** Question about learning English 
** Not sure what to ask? 
*** Read this: [[Study Skills - ask good questions]]
*** Copy one of the question patterns
*** CHANGE the question
* 2) Send me an email asking your question. 
** Use what you learned in [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]]
** (e.g. it should start "Dear Malc," and end "Regards,")
** If you're not sure, just copy "Example email 2" 
** I will answer 
** I will give you feedback on your email style 
** If it needs work, I will ask you to try again

# Homework 2 - Read your syllabus
* 1) Read these important points first
** Don't worry about "Assessment". Just read.
** I will explain that later, step by step
* 2) Read your Syllabus:
** [[Schedules - Syllabus for ECS]]
** [[Schedules - Syllabus for EITC]]
** [[Schedules - Syllabus for GCP]]
** [[Schedules - Syllabus for SSB]]
* 3) If you have a question, send an email!
