When you are looking for sources, try this:

# 1) Read in your language first and find the main idea keywords
* Read the Japanese Wikipedia page
* Google the topic in Japanese


# 2) Translate the main idea keywords into English.
For example:
Endangered Animals |Pollution, hunting, poaching, global warming, bycatch Wildlife preserves, farmer compensation, CITES, ban on hunting
Ethical  Consumption |Air/Water/Soil pollution, Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, boycott, product labelling, 
Criteria-Analysis/// Compare-Contrast /// Cost, weight, size, durability, battery time, sustainability, screen size, safety, 

# 3) Now search for those keywords for your specific context
* e.g. Galapagos penguin warming ocean
* e.g. Syrian Refugee destruction of hospitals

### Use Google
* English Google search https://google.com
* Japanese Google search https://google.co.jp
* News Google Search http://news.google.com
* Remember you can 
** Limit it to governmental sites (“Galapagos penguin site:gov” or “site:.gov.jp”
** Limit it to university sites (“Galapagos penguin global warming site:ac.jp” or “site:ac.jp”)
** Limit it to recent articles using _Search Tools_
** Limit it to exact matches with quotees "". See the difference this makes:
** amazon "ngo japan" 
** "amazon ngo" japan

### More Academic searches
* Google Scholar http://scholar.google.com 	(has most but not all articles)
** Find an important source - the classic source everyone uses.
** Click "Cited by"
* CiNii (Japanese university articles) http://ci.nii.ac.jp/en/		
* Eric http://www.eric.ed.gov/
* Ethos (British Dissertations) http://ethos.bl.uk/ 		
* ARDR (Japanese dissertations) https://dbr.nii.ac.jp		
* Reading lists prepared by expert on topic: e.g.  http://www.readinglists.manchester.ac.uk/index.html
* Browse top journals on your topic: http://www.journalindicators.com/indicators

### Search a specific newspaper
* [[Resources - websites for English news articles]]

Remember:
* To get academic PDFs
** You might need to be AT UNIVERSITY (or use a VPN)
** If you're lucky, Google Scholar might find free copies on other websites.
* TO get books
** Check your own library: http://sul.soka.ac.jp/
** Download a sample chapter from Google Books or Amazon Kindle
** Find copies in nearby libraries	(some let visitors borrow): http://ci.nii.ac.jp/books/

# 4) Save the good sources
* You probably found too much. 
** Journals: Read the abstracts. Only download and read references that are useful for you.
** News etc: Skim it quickly before you read. 
* Save the PDF (or PRINT the web page as PDF)
** It's easier to take notes on a PDF 
** If the original article is moved,you still have it

# 6) Once you’ve found a good source, find the sources that article uses. Read those!
* Follow links at the bottom of the Wikipedia article
* For academic sources, use Google Scholar
** Click “cited by” (e.g. “ 引用元”) or related article (関連記事)
choose popular ones - if older article shave few citations, they’re not important
“引用元 6893”, not “引用元 1”
** It might not be available off-campus. Make sure you are on university wifi.
** The main link might not be available. Click see all and look for PDFs. 

# 7) Avoid bad sources
You can READ these for your own information, but don't USE them in your essay:
* Dictionaries
* Wikipedia
* Any other kind of Wiki that anyone can edit. 
* Any other kind of "pedia", including normal Encyclopaedias. 
* Any "question answering" asite
** Quora answers
** Yahoo answers
** About.com
* Something your teacher said in class (you need to find something they WROTE!)

See [[Invention - check source quality]]


# 8) Read it once and annotate
* Before you read, get your brain ready:
** What do you already know?
** What do you think you will learn?
* Skim it 
** the section headings and table/figure titles
** the thesis statement 
** the conclusion
* While reading:
** Highlight important keywords, points, and quotes.
** Write comments in the margins


# 9) Read it again and take notes
### Take good notes
When you read these notes in the future, it will be easier if you:
* TYPE your notes - they're harder to lose and easier to search
** Word, text files, Excel all popular
** Dissertation? Try Zotero  https://www.zotero.org
* Summarize and keep it short
** Don't copy lots of long chunks. 
** If you do copy a quote, use quote marks so you remember who wrote it
* Give page numbers if available so you can find facts again easily
* Write a one-sentence summary with citation
** "According to Suzuki (2012), in a METHOD study of SUBJECTS, RESULT"
** Do this well enough, and you can just copy it into your essay later.

### Use Note English
Notes should be FAST to write and FAST to read:
* No sentences!
* Important information only
* Remove unnecessary words (a, he, on, in, the, is, are)
* Make it quicker to write and to read:
** "Two thirds of growth at Pepsi came from better foods"
** "two thirds growth Pepsi frm better foods"
** "2/3 growth @ Pepsi = better foods"


### Also take notes on:
* YOUR ideas 
** Do you agree/disagree?
** Is the conclusion supported?
** Was the research method OK?
** Is there any bias? See [[Invention - check source quality]]
* Language (e.g. useful words and phrases)
* What the article did NOT tell you (especially if you're preparing for a dissertation project)
* things/ideas you should research next (copy the reference or link)
* things you should you do differently (e.g. research methods)


# 10) Don't forget the reference
* See [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]
* See [[Invention - use APA format in reference lists]]
