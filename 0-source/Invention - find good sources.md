This page is about research sources. For other kinds of support you can use in your essays, see [[Invention - recognise types of evidence]]

# Avoid bad sources
You can READ these for your own information, but don't USE them in your essay:
* Dictionaries
* Wikipedia
** Any other kind of Wiki that anyone can edit. 
** Any other kind of "pedia", including normal Encyclopaedias. 
* Any "question answering" asite
** Quora answers
** Yahoo answers
** About.com
* Comments 
** Blog comments
** TED Talks comments
* Something your teacher said in class (you need to find somethign they WROTE!)


# Find good sources
## Good sources for an essay
Are mostly:
* News articles
* NGO reports
* Government reports
* High quality personal websites by experts

## Good sources for a dissertation
Are different and more difficult. 
I don't expect your to read these for your essay, but use them if you have read something useful (even in Japanese) for other courses:
* Academic articles
** Try Google Scholar (English or Japanese): https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Galapagos+ penguin+ warming+ ocean&btnG=
** Try a normal Google search for the topic, but add "site:.ac.jp" "site:.ac.uk" or "site:.edu"
** Try CiNii (mostly Japanese): http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ja
* Academic books
* Essay type sources also OK for background, but should be only a few of these


# How to find good sources
## 1) Get an overview and collect some search keywords
* Read but don't cite:
** the Japanese Wikipedia page - learn wheat the main problems/issues are
** the matching English Wikipedia page
*** learn what the keywords for the issues are in English
*** click any useful links AWAY from wikipedia
* Google the topic in Japanese
** Read two things in Japanese to help you understand the general topic
** Take a note of any other good keywords to use - you might need to translate them


## 2) Choose the best keywords
### You should have collected something like this:

Essay               |Problem keywords                                       |Solution keywords                          
--------------------|-------------------                                    |------------------- 
Endangered animals  |Pollution, hunting, poaching, global warming, bycatch  |RRR, boycott, product labelling,                                  
Ethical Consumption |Air/Water/Soil pollution                               |Wildlife preserves, farmer compensation, CITES, ban on hunting                              
Criteria-Analysis   |Cost, weight, size, durability, battery time, sustainability, screen size, safety,                         

### Side note:  Keywords for problems-solutions essays
* Solution keywords do not need to be the same as problem keywords. A general solution to the problem is OK. 
* If problems are  food, health, and security, then solutions CAN be about food, health, and security...
* But they don't NEED to be. General solutions  also OK:  
** E.g. refugees food, health, security  issues also partly solved by:
*** Repatriation to safe home country after peace treaty
*** Improving chances of resettlement in 3rd country
*** Working with host country to encourage integration
*** The multi-issue work of a large group like UNHCR

## 3) Start searching using your keywords. 
Normal Google web search is full of rubbish. Narrow it down:
* Use specific keywords
** Galapagos penguin warming ocean
** Syrian Refugee destruction of hospitals
* Use quotes to get an exact phrase search: - it can be different: 
** amazon "ngo japan": https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=amazon+ %22ngo+ japan%22
** "amazon ngo" japan: https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&ei=ZBb7XZ-mIKuTr7wP24idoAo&q=%22amazon+ ngo%22+ japan&oq=%22amazon+ ngo%22+ japan
* Use dates under "Search Tools" to find recent news/articles
* Click “News” and choose a good recent news article
* Use Google Scholar instead (Japanese OK): https://scholar.google.com/
* Limit it to governmental sites (“Galapagos penguin site:gov” or “site:.gov.jp”
* Limit it to university sites (“Galapagos penguin global warming site:ac.jp” or “site:ac.jp”)
* If you want more academic sources in Japanese, try Cinii instead: https://ci.nii.ac.jp/

## 4) Follow the links!
Once you’ve found a good source, find the sources that article uses. Read those!
* For example, on Google Scholar
** Click “cited by” (e.g. “ 引用元”) or related article (関連記事)
** choose popular ones - if older article shave few citations, they’re not important
** “引用元 6893”, not “引用元 1”
** It might not be available off-campus. Make sure you are on university wifi.
** xThe main link might not be available. Click see all and look for PDFs.
