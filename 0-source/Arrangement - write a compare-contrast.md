#Overview
##Compare contrast can be:
*A whole essay
*A paragraph
*A sentence or two in a paragraph usually Description or Analysis

For sentence patterns, see [[Style - write a compare-contrast sentence]]
This page is about structure for compare-contrast PARAGRAPHS and longer

##Terms
Compare= "Same", Contrast= "Different". For example:
*Tokyo & Osaka
*Yoshinoya  & McDonalds
*Squid & Octopus
*Two World Heritage Sites

#Invention
*Think about all 5 senses - touch smell taste sight feel
*Do not choose things that are too big (US & China) or too different (cats & bananas)
*Try a “same and different” Venn diagram: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram
