# Problems with answer the question
## Attack the person								(ad hominem)
* "He's a Biologist, not a Climatologist, so what he says about Global Warming is wrong" 
* "You can't argue for vegetarianism and wear leather shoes" 			(tu quoque)
* "But last year you argued the opposite! How can we believe you now?" 	(tu quoque)
* "Of course you think Yokohama is best. You're from Yokohama!" 	(circumstance)
	
## Change or simplify the argument to make it easier to attack	(strawman)
Bob: "We should do a study abroad to learn about other cultures"
Fred: "Bob said that knowing Japanese culture alone is not enough. I disagree…."

## Ad Hoc rescue (No true Scotsman)
Bob: All Japanese people eat rice 
Hiro: I'm Japanese, and I hate rice. So you're wrong. 
Bob: No TRUE Japanese person hates rice.

## Relativist Fallacy (subjectivist fallacy)
"I'm entitled to my own opinion"
"I don't have to eat vegetables. My blood type is A"

## Loaded Question: 
"When did you stop cheating on your homework?"
		 
## Perfectionist Fallacy
"Criminals do not obey gun laws. So we should not have gun laws"

## Fallacy of the Middle Ground/ Golden Mean/Moderation: 
"London is in England. You think it is in Japan. Let's agree that it's near India. "
"You say we need a 100% cut in nuclear weapons. I say 0%. How about 50%?

## False Choice / False Dichotomy / False Dilemma / Excluded Middle:
"If you're not with us, you're against us"
"Either quit your part-time job and study more, or quit University and get a job" 

# Causation and Sampling
## Begging the Question
* (conclusion included in question)		(petitio principii)
* BQ: "Labelling products with nutritional information will help people eat better"

## Tautology 
"Milk makes me sleepy because it has a soporific quality"
He’s good at sports because he’s an athlete.
It's illegal because it's against the law

## (assuming only one explanation, ignoring other causes or common causes)
Bananas are shaped like they are so humans can eat them

 
## Slippery Slope: 
	"If we let gay people marry, next people will be marrying their pets"	

## Confusing Cause and effectw
You might hear people say: Correlation is not causation 
** "I started sneezing when I saw her, so she must have given me a cold" (cum hoc)
** "I started sneezing after I saw her, so she must have given me a cold" (post hoc)
* Panda populations are decreasing. Temperature are doing up. Pandas cool the world. (Ignoring common cause)  
* (Denying the antecedent)
* (Affirming the Consequent)
						
## Bad sampling / Hasty generalisation
You might hear people say: "the plural of anecdote is not data"
* "My grandfather smoked every day and lived to be 114, so smoking must be OK"
* "Electronics companies are evil. Look at Apple in China."
* "90% of people asked by email, said that email was useful"
* "Crime is going up in Japan, as can be seen from all the news reports" (Spotlight)

## Confirmation Bias (accidental - when deliberate, "Cherry Picking")
* 1000 articles that say yes, one that says no, and you only read the "no".
 
## Composition (nature of a part is the nature of the whole): 
* "My computer is made of cheap silicon and metal, so it should be cheap."
* "Vaccines contain a compound of mercury. Mercury is dangerous. So vaccines are dangerous"

## Division (nature of the whole is the nature of the part)
* "You like ketchup, so you must like tomatoes!"
		 
## Undistributed middle / Ambiguity:
* Evolution is a theory. Theory is not fact. Therefore evolution is not true. 
 
# Appeals to Bad Evidence
## Appeal to Authority: 
* "As Einstein said...." 		
* "9 out of 10 doctors smoke Camels"
* "They say that..." (Appeal to Anonymous authority)

## Appeal to nature: 
* "We shouldn't inoculate babies, because the ingredients are not natural."

## Appeal to Emotion 
* Fear: "If we don't act now, immigrants will take our jobs"
* Flattery: "Intelligent people like yourselves already know that
* Ridicule: "What kind of idiot would believe that?"
* Pity: "You should give him an A. His dog is sick."
* Spite: "He didn't vote for me, so I won't vote for him"

## Appeal to Consequences / Wishful Thinking			 (ad consequentiam)
* "If that were true, then I would be sad. So it's now true"
* "If that were true, I wouldn't be able to sleep. So it's not true"
	
## Appeal to confusion
* "I don't understand how magnets work, so all science is suspect"
* "The eye is too complicated a structure to have evolved"

## Appeal to unconnected quality
* "It's more expensive/newer, so it's better"

## "Most people"
* Appeal to Belief: "Most people think that carrots improve eyesight"
* Appeal to Popularity: "Most people agree we should reduce immigration"
* Appeal to Common Practice "Most people smoke - it must be ok" 		
* Appeal to Tradition: "It has always been done that way"
* Bandwagon: "All my friends would laugh at me if I said I believed that"

## Burden of Proof (ad ignorantiam)
You might hear people say: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence	
* "Prove it! You can't, can you?"
* "There is no evidence that psychic powers do not exist"
* "The tests didn’t find anything, so you’re not sick"

## Genetic Fallacy / Guilt by Association
* "My dad told me, so it must be true"
* "I don't believe it - it was on TV, and everything on TV is a lie"
* "The manufacturer paid for this investigation, so it cannot be believed"
* "How can you be a vegetarian? Hitler was a vegetarian!"

# Others
## Red Herring (irrelevant topic)

## Poisoning the well
* "By the way, don't listen to anything he says. He's being paid to say it"
	
## Gamblers Fallacy: 
* "I've rolled three sixes in a row. The next one will not be a six."


## Unfalsifiable claim

## Lying and suppressing evidence

## Misleading vividness

## Special Pleading
		
## Fallacy fallacy
* "That's a fallacy, so it can't be true!"
* "We should vaccinate children, because anti-vaccine writers' arguments are flawed"
