# Make your own email
### 1) Subject Line
Put your Name, class name, and homework code (or problem keyword) in the subject line
*Hiroko Sato - SSGB - A2
*Hiroko Sato - ECB - A3
*Hiroko Sato - ECB - A essay outline
*Hiroko Sato - GCP - B3
*Hiroko Sato - SSGB - Outline 2A
*Hiroko Sato - SSGB - Question about Thursday homework

### 2) Start with a greeting
e.g. "Malc,"					| Very informal
e.g. "Hi Malc,"					| Informal <blue>use this one</blue>
e.g. "Dear Mr Prentice," 		| Formal <red>if you use this one I will think you are in trouble :-)</red>
e.g. "To Whom it May Concern:" 	| Try not to use this. ///Try to find out who you are emailing
e.g. "Dear Sir/Madam," 			| Try not to use this. ///Try to find out who you are emailing
e.g. "Hi, Everyone"				| Informal, emailing a group of friends
e.g. "Dear All, "				| Informal to a group - maybe

### 3) If you haven't emailed someone in a while
Usually, you should ask a question or tell them something before asking them for something.
You see me every week, so you don't need this when you email me now.
*"I hope you are well."
*"How have you been?"
*"How are things?"


### 4) Say the main thing
"Please find attached my Essay C3"
"I was absent on Tuesday - can you tell me my team name"
"Here is my homework"
"Here is my report. Sorry it is late. "
"I was sick last week. Can I have an extension on A3"

### 5) Add a thanks/hope phrase (optional for informal emails)
 <blue>Thanks in advance.</blue> 	|if it's something normal like marking an essay or sending info
I hope you can help. 				|if it's something less common, like a reference
I hope to hear from you.			|if you're expecting a reply - quite formal
Let me know							|informal - if there's a chance they'll say "no"

### 6) Add a polite written goodbye phrase
Be careful - most have __commas__ not periods
Cheers,			 		| people you know well
Best,					| people you know well
<blue>Regards,</blue> 	| people you know well
Best Regards,			| people you know well
Yours,					| people you know
Your sincerely, 		| formal - you started "Dear Mr. Smith,"
Yours faithfully,		| formal - you started "Dear Sir/Madam"

### 7) Your name
For this class, also give your student number in brackets
<br>
Regards,
<br>
Hiroko Sato <blue>(20150001)</blue>

# Common mistakes
### <red>1) Use the correct attachment name!</red>
*Class-Name-Code
*Hyphens
*No spaces.
<green>OK</green>: 	Hiroko Sato-SSGB-RR1.docx

<green>OK</green>:	Hiroko Sato-ECB- AOutline.docx

<green>OK</green>:	Hiroko Sato-TOEFL-B3.docx

<red>NO:</red> 		Document1.docx
<red>NO:</red> 		Hiroko.docx
<red>NO:</red> 		A3.docx



### 2) Please don't email me to say thank you!
I get 100 emails a week from students (essays, questions).
If everyone emails "thank you" when I answer, I get __200!__
You don't need to thank me for answering. It's my job!
Send a "thank you" maximum __once,__ at the end of term.

### 3) Ignore the "Footer"
Your email will maybe automatically add something like this:


>>--///鈴木大志(創価大学)　経営学部経営学科 /// e1659abc@soka-u.jp ///学籍番号　e1659abc///
///
This is fine but it __does not replace__ the things above. You still need to actually write your name on a line of its own in romaji. It still needs to be



>>Regards, /// ///Taishi Suzuki ///--///鈴木大志(創価大学)　経営学部経営学科 /// e1659abc@soka-u.jp ///学籍番号　e1659abc///
