# Write a FIRST summary sentence
When summarising what you read/listen to, good summary sentence will:

* mention the main keyword(s)
* not too much or too little detail
* not copy-pasted from the abstract / summary / cover

|Smith (1999)                |gives the example(s) of X  |                       |                         | NO CITATION
