We're going to practice negotiating language.

# Task 1: trade with your partner for something

# Task 2: Monopoly
The rules are similar to "Jinsei Game". I will explain in class.
### Game language
* Your turn.
* Is it my turn?
* Can you move my token 3 squares? It's the boot.
* Can you pass me a chance card?
* Can you pass the dice?
* I'd like to buy this property please
* That's mine. Please pay $32 ("32 dollars") rent
* Here you are.
### Banker language
* Would you like to buy it?
* Here you are.
* If you want to get out of jail, you can pay...



# Useful language
## Proposal (offer, suggestion)
* If you X I will Y (high chance of X)
* If you Xed I would Y (low chance of X)
* If I X, will you
* If I Xed, would you
* I'll give you two choices - either X or Y
* I propose we VERB
* How about we VERB
* Would it be possible to X
* How would you feel if we Xed...
* Do you think you could consider Xing
* How about you do X and I do Y?

## Checking at the end of a long proposal
* Is that OK with you?
* How does that sound?
* Would that work?

## Clarifying a proposal
* So, you mean....
* XXXX - that's correct, isn't it?
* Could you just summarise that for me one more time?
* Can you give me an example?
* So what I think you're saying is X. Is that right?

## Asking for more room or time
* Can you give me some time to talk to my partner?
* I'll have to check with my boss
* Are you flexible on that number?
* Would you be willing to...
* Could we compromise on...


## Refusing
* I'm sorry, but that doesn't work for us.
* I don't think that's going to work.
* I'm afraid we can't do that.
* Unfortunately, that's not quite...
* That's a fair offer, but...
* I'm sorry, but we can't accept that.
* That would be quite difficult.

## Accepting
* Great!
* Done!
* Deal!
* I believe we have a deal!
* That's sounds reasonable. Let's do it.


## Accepting with conditions
* Done, but only on the condition that X.
* OK, but we're going to have to insist that...
* As long as X, then we have a deal.
* We would be willing to accept that only if

## Counter proposal
Use one of these plus another offer phrase:
* Instead,...
* May I offer an alternative?....
* THat might work. But perhaps

## Closing
* OK, just to check. You will... and we will...
* SO, what we agreed on was to X and Y
* Let's just summarise...
* It was a pleasure doing business with you.
