# General tips
*Double check your cohesion: if you say “Section 3.1 below looks at X” - please check it is still 3.1, and is still below
*Split it up into stages (chapter deadlines/friend check/teacher check/final draft/paper copy bound and printer). Put these in your calendar

# Style
*[[Style - follow academic conventions]]
*Average sentence length in an academic report is 20 words or so.
*Avoid over-using the passive  (It was noticed that....)
*“Data” is plural, so “As the data shows" is technically wrong (not everyone agrees). 
See [[Style - language for dissertations]]


# Delivery
*Use styles for section headings
**less time spent fiddling
**you can autogenerate your table of contents, list of tables and list of figures. 
**Watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOjfIjpMTMs
*Read the University rules. 	
*Look at some dissertations by your sempai.  	
*There are probably rules for  margins, binding, paper, font, page numbers, etc
*My preferences, if the university says nothing:
**Left justified 12 point, double spaced Times New Roman font. 
**Do not double space tables and references.
**2cm left margin, 1cm top right and bottom.
**APA style. Here is an example from OWL at Purdue: https://www.google.co.jp/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwj28cOdv8_WAhWHG5QKHcVnAYMQjBAIMzAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fowl.english.purdue.edu%2Fowl%2Fresource%2F560%2F18%2F&usg=AOvVaw3oP7lRnREgxXz0iMnZZTZG
