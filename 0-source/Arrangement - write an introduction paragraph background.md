# What is "background"?

# What if my topic is already the top level?
Sometimes, you cannot use "one of the most" for SB, because your topic is already at the top level in its category. For example, if your IB is paper, what is your GB? Trees?

### Option 2) GB = TOPIC, SB = problem, IB = example of problem making importance clear
