# What is a thesis statement (TS)?
* A thesis statement gives the _topic,_ and the _main idea_ of your essay.
* It helps your reader understand what they are reading.

# Are thesis statements and a topic sentences different?
You have already written a topic sentence for a paragraph. A Thesis Statement is the topic sentence of your larger essay/section/chapter/
* <blue>Topic sentences</blue> describe the TOPIC and the MAIN IDEA of a <green>BODY PARAGRAPH</green>, and they usually give one keyword for each of the <red>POINTS</red> you make in the <green>paragraph</green>. A <blue>topic sentence</blue> is the <pink>FIRST</pink> sentence of your <orange>body</orange> paragraphs.
* <blue>Thesis statements</blue> describe the TOPIC and the MAIN IDEA of your <green>WHOLE ESSAY</green>, and they usually give one keyword for each of the <red>PARAGRAPHS or SECTIONS</red> in the <green>essay</green>. A <blue>thesis statement</blue> is the <pink>LAST</pink> sentence of your <orange>introduction</orange> paragraph.


In formal essays, they use the same patterns
* Thesis Statement: "This essay argues that X is Y"
* Topic Sentence: "This paragraph argues that X is Y"."

If your essay is _over five_ paragraphs:
* read the rules for how to [[Arrangement - write a sectional essay]]
* you will need more thesis statements!


# Thesis Statement = "Topic", "Main Idea" and "Keyword"
Topic 		|NAME the topic of your essay 			|(Giant Pandas, Paper, an NGO name)
Main Idea 	|What are you trying to say about it. 	        |comparing it to something? Arguing it is the best? Describing problems?)
keywords 	|one word/phrase per paragraphs 		|food+ air+ water, step 1+ step2+ step3, reason+ reason2+ reason3

Keywords are tricky - see [[Style - use keywords]]


# A thesis statement is not:
Not a title 		| ~~Study Abroad: Good or Bad?~~
Not about you 		| ~~I will introduce Study Abroad~~
Not a definition 	| ~~Study Abroad is learning overseas~~
Not too big	        | ~~This essay describes ALL Study Abroad types~~
Not too vague		| ~~Study abroad is good~~

## Pattern 0: First year essays
Keep it simple. Copy the example.

### Ethical Consumerism

* This essay first describes __Tantalum__ in detail, then looks at some problems __its production__ causes, and then finally outlines some possible solutions to those problems.

* Be careful about causes and effects
** is the product itself is dangerous (e.g. mercury/plastic)
** or is just __"its production"__ dangerous (e.g. diamonds/cotton/paper)
* Be careful about plurals and countable nouns?
** Uncountable? Use "its" (Tantalum, cotton)

** both OK, but don't mix!

### Voluntourism: Criteria-Analysis
