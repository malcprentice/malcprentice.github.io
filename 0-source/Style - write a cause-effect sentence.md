###  Verb outcomes
X                   |, so                           |Y.
X happens           |, and so                       |Y happens.
                    |. Therefore,                   |Y increases.
                    |, and therefore                |Y is getting worse
                    |. Because of this,             |Y gets worse
                    |, and because of this          |there is a change in Y
                    |. Hence,                       |there is an increase in Y
                    |, and hence,                   |

                    |, and as a result,             |
                    |. The result is that           |
                    |, and the result is that       |
                    |. One result of this is that   |
                    |. As a consequence,            |
                    |, and consequently,            |
                    |, and as a consequence,        |
                    |. Consequently                 |
                    |. For this reason,             |
                    |, and for this reason,         |
                    |. Accordingly,                 |
                    |Thus,                          |
                    |, and thus,                    |
