# How to do a combined article

* Start the same as akways
* However, AFTER you watch the lecture or do the first reading, then:
** Google the topic
** find an article (web, news, academic) about the SAME TOPIC
** Read that too.

# Notes section difference
Put notes from BOTH lecture AND article into one set of notes.
* Use the normal template, but
** put a citation (“Title,” n.d.)
** on each notes section (Suzuki, 2018, July 3)
** make it clear which fact came from which source
** i.e. same as when you do your essay outline.

# In the summary
* First [[Style - write a summary sentence]] about the first article/lecture (e.g. "In this talk, the speaker”)
* Then SUMMARISE your second article but make the linke between them CLEAR (support? disagree? disprove?)
* Don't forget to cite BOTH articles in the summary
* APA for your Summary is here: [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]


## Option 1: Citation only (Safe)

|However, 		|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|says that
|In fact, 		|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|notes that
|Additionally, 	|Suzuki (2018, Febrary 1) 	|points out that
|For example, 	|Suzuki (2018, February 1) 	|describes


## Option 2: describe source (trickier)

|Link 				|SOURCE TYPE 			|source  					|citation word+  reading summary 		|Citation
|--------------------|---------------		|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------
|However 			|, an article 			|in the Washington Post 	|notes that this is not true because X	|(Smith, 2019, January 1)
|Despite this 		|, a law 				|passed by the US congress 	|has banned X 							|(Yamada, n.d.)
|Meanwhile, 			|, protestors 			|are claiming that  		|this will have (no/real) impact, as X  |(UNESCO, 2017)
|On the other hand 	|, data collected  		|by a survey agency 		|shows this is (un)true, since 			|("UNESCO," 2017)
|Elsewhere, however 	|, similar work 		|by another GROUP 			|(does not) confirm this to be the case	|("Trees," 2016b)
|In fact 		  	|, recent research by 	|scientists working for the UN|has (dis)proved 						|("Newts," 2018, June 3)
|In addition			|, a report 			|by the Department of Work	|suggests otherwise, as X				|("Penguins," n.d.)
|Supporting this 	|, recent evidence from |satellite imaging 			|clearly indicates that X 				|(Suzuki, 2017)
|Confirming this are |recent reports  		|by local NGOs 				|that X 								|
|Casting doubt on this|,a recent report 		|by a government spokesperson|rejects X 							|

## Option 42: So many choices
For more citation words and patterns, see the Invention sheets.


# In the references section
Don’t forget:
* put BOTH sources in the References section
* IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER.
