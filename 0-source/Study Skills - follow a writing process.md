###Think and research

*Do research online

###Before you start writing, you need:
*Find out what you need (e.g. 3 problems, 3 solutions, 3 comparisons)
*research MORE than 3 points
*Share your research in class
*Choose the best 3
*If you can't find enough points, change your topic!

###Comment systen
I will use Microsoft Word comments.

*If you don't understand my comment
**come to office hours
**Follow the email example "asking for feedback" [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]]

i.e. A3/B4/C4 (if you did writing centre, version 4)
*FIX the comment and DELETE the comment
*Fix ALL comments. If you do not understand, ASK me.
*If you ignore comments (e.g. B3 and B4 are the same), you wasted my time.
*Ignore my feedback = <red>automatic D.</red> (maximum)
