Exact formatting is hard to describe - while you read this, look at the example file in Shared Materials folder  ("Style - using figures and tables.docx")

#APA rules for Tables and Figures
*Always refer to ANY figure/table at least once in the text 
**("As Figure 1 shows", "As Table 3 indicates")
**See [[Style - describe figures and tables]]
*Don't forget units (kg,m,s)
*Explain any abbreviations in a note BELOW the item. Start the note with "Note." I should be able to understand your table/figure without reading the article
*Don't use titles built into Excel/Word graphs. Delete that and add your own typed title.
*Make sure your title, figure, notes are all on the same page.

#APA rules for tables
*Give the Table number ("Table 1")
*On the next line, give the title in italic
*Next, give the table. Give the title ABOVE tables (opposite for figures)
*Title should stand alone, so you need to mention both the X and Y axis ("Increase in Y between time X1 and X2")
*Don't let the table split across pages, or get separated from its title.
*only horizontal lines, and only for headers and bottom
*no vertical lines in APA style
*Leave a blank line between the table and the rest of the text.
*Leave a blank line between the table number and the table.
*Centre align the numbers and column headers inside their columns
*Left align the first column, which contains the row headers
For figures (graphs/charts/maps/photos/diagrams)
*Give the title below “Figure 3: % AWL words by genre”
*Make sure it looks good in Black and White.

#APA rules for For Figures
*Give the title BELOW
*Title should stand alone,
*Include the raw data in an appendix if you can
*Use the right type of chart/graph
**Pie charts = 100% of something
**Graphs = change over time
**Bar charts = comparing amounts
**Label axes (Number of students passing)
**Don’t distort the scale
**x axis is for independent variable
**Use totals, not percentages




#Cite tables/figures from another source
This section needs checking. There may be errors. Before you use it, let me know.The reason there may be errors is that most writers and researchers do not this - the only data is from their own research. It would be better to describe the data in words or make your own data/figure. However, if it is necessary, just say where you got it:
*"Adapted": you changed it
*"Reprinted from": it's copied

###Figures
_Figure 3:_ Change in forest cover by year. Adapted from Smith (1999)
_Figure 3:_ Change in forest cover by year. Reprinted from from Smith (1999)

Then give the APA reference in the References section

###Tables
Give the citation in a note under the table
Do NOT put it in your references section - give the reference here in caption style:
*no burasage
*give only one page number
*copyright is probably publisher (Ingenta, Oxford, Cambridge, a university)
*Copyright might not be correct. Sometimes there will be a copyright-free license, such as "Creative Commons BY-SA"
*If only some data is copied, say what ("The data in column 1 are from")
