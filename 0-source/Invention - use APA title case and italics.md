# Italics = the thing you hold 
In the text, italics means you emphasize mean something. Don't use it for references. 
* Good: ("Title of an article," n.d.)
* Bad: ("<em>Title of an article,</em>" n.d.)

In the references section, italics means "this is the thing you look for in the library"

|What do you hold?							   |What do you NOT hold?
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------
|The book title 							 |not the chapter title - you don't rip it out
|The magazine/journal						|not the article title - you don't rip it out
|The newspaper								|not the article title - you don't rip it out 
| 											|not software. CDs are not software
|The volume number of a journal 				|4-6 issues are bound together by the library ///you don't rip the issue out again

# Title Case = a collection of similar work by different people
Note - this has changed from previous rules. Some of the essay examples might be wrong. 

1) Title Case for Journal Names
*The International Journal of Stuff
*Applied Penguin Quarterly
2) No title case for books, chapters, articles, reports, webpages: However, first letter after colon still gets capital
Things that CONTAIN similar texts written by many people get Title Case:

|Type			|Collection Title - Title Case 					|Item Title - No title case
|------			|------											|------
|News 			|Newspaper Title 								|Newspaper article title
|Book 			|Edited Book (Chapters by many Authors) 	 	|Book by one author
|Journal 		|Journal Title 									|Journal article title
|Video Collection |YouTube, TED Talks  							|Video title


# What about websites?

Are they website versions of something else, or just websites?  

### News websites
Pretend they are actual newspapers. 
* italics & title case for site name(<em>BBC Online, Mainichi Daily </em>)
* no italics, no title case for video title

### Encyclopaedias
* Doesn't matter - you <red>should not be citing these anyway</red>

### Video collections
Are collections
* italics and title case for the website (<em>YouTube, TED Talks</em>)
* no italics, no title case for article title

### Normal websites (e.g. the Soka University website)
*Don't cite normal website names at all. Cite ONLY the page title. 
*Just give the page title - normal websites are places to find sources (like libraries), not sources. 

For the article title (the page title)
* Italics but no title case
* imagine you printed the website __page__ - you hold it, so italics
* Websites are not collections - they are libraries. No title case. 

### Organisation websites hosting official reports
* Use the Organisation name as AUTHOR, not title. 
** So no italics
** Not a collection but it __IS__ the name of something, 
*** People, Organisation names get Title Case
*** (Soka University, Children in Need, World Health Organisation)
* For the report name
** italics yes (you print it and hold it)
** Title case no (does not contain a collection of similar work by different people)

# Academic Journal numbers - more details
In the library, there are many magazines, journals, and "kiyou" (university published journals). 
<a href="http://imgur.com/cJOaEAa"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/cJOaEAa.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

They often have an English AND a Japanese cover
* English journal title is "The Journal of International Law and Diplomacy"
* This journal's Japanese title is 国際外交雑誌
* use the English title when writing in English. 
<a href="http://imgur.com/zuikN8J"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/zuikN8J.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

 
* Look at the volume number (113) 
** Volume number usually = years
** This journal started in 1912
** "113" = 113 years old in 2014
* Look at the issue number (1). Here:
** (1)=spring issue
** (2)=summer issue
** (3)=fall issue
** (4)=winter issue
** For  other journals it depends 
*** 1-12 = monthly
*** 1-52 = weekly
*** 1-2 = every 6 months
 
The reference for one of the articles on the cover is:

<ref>
Okano, Y. (2014). The Brussels I regulation recast. <em>The Journal of International Law and Diplomacy, 113</em>(1), 30-53. 
</ref>


### Note: volume number "113" in italics. Issue number "(1)" not.
* Journals can only stay in the front of the library for a while. 
* Soon they go into the back of the library to be stored. 
* They will be stored as individual issues for a while:
<a href="http://imgur.com/UhXByHl"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/UhXByHl.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

Eventually, the library binds them into single books. 
<a href="http://imgur.com/jkqR24s"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/jkqR24s.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>
One book = one volume. The issues are now inside.
<a href="http://imgur.com/nYzP86V"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/nYzP86V.jpg" title="source: imgur.com" /></a>

For most articles, you go to the library to find (and hold) the BOUND BOOK of the VOLUME, not the issue. 
* The THING YOU HOLD gets italics 
** You don't hold the articles - no italics for article titles 
** You hold the journal - Journal Title gets italics
** However, also, most issues are BOUND. 
*** You don't hold the issues. No italics for issue number
*** You hold that year's VOLUME book. Italics for volume number

### Also
* COLLECTIONS get title case
* The journal COLLECTS several works by several author
** The Journal name is Title Case
** The article title is not.
