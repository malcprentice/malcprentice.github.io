# Evaluation/Assessment Fall draft
## 1) Changes to presentations
** was 4, now 3 presentation (Team ABC -  once every 3 weeks)
** Two practice, one graded
** final presentation was 10%, now 20% (10% slides, 10% video)
** Hard to grade eye contact in Spring with tiny-head videos, so video now face only please

## 2) Changes to essay
* outlines not assessed 
* 

## 3) Changes to ALC


## 4) Changes to SR
* I think we have too much homework, so let's just do ONE book this term
* If your reading speed is still slow, then feel free to do more books. No points though. 
* Half the work, so half the grade: 5% 

## 5) TOEIC in winter
* In December there will be an online TOEIC test. This is free, and required.
* 5% to encourage you to sign up and take the test. 

## 6) No changes to QW
* You can repeat topics but change content (e.g. "my favourite movie" but talk about a different movie)
* Minimum word count starts at 150. Read instructions for increases in Fall. 

## 7) Changes to participation
* Max 1 point for ALC. No more points for doing multiple tests or longer tests. Too many students were not making effort on later tests. I know what your real TOIEC scores are and/or some students dropped from 60%+ on test 1 to around 25% on tests 2 and 3. When this happens (and it happened a lot) I know you're not trying. There is no completely reliable way for me to check effort, so instead I'm just limiting ALC to maximum 1 point ( a "try it" point). One (correct) screenshot only. 
* ... so you should replace ALC with more QW, or EF, WC, etc. 
* Not a change, but remember that EF, WC, GV etc is MAXIMUM ONE POINT

## 8) Changes to Vocab
* No change in learning method - just continue with lists or collecting new words
* Tests will be video ON, eyes COVERED. I can't think of any other way to do this.
