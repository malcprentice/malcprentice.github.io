# What is a case study?
In a case study you study a complicated problem by
*choosing one example
*analysing it carefully.
*saying what the example shows us about the big problem.

### We will write about a LACK:
*a lack of access to healthcare is the example. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS
*a lack of access to education
*a lack of safe water
*a lack of access to mains electricity (e.g. in slums)
*a lack of access to sanitation (e.g. toilet, not field)
*a lack of security
*a lack of human rights (human trafficking, freedom of speech/religion)
*a lack of mobility (bad roads, no transport, long travel to hospital/school/water)
*A lack of X (finish this sentence to generate more topics: "In Japan, we take it for granted that we can....., however this is not true for everyone around the world."

### Which Country?
GCP: You will be visiting the Phillipines between first and second year. Let's learn more before you go. Read part 1 (Executive summary) of this: http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/27529/poverty-philippines-causes-constraints-opportunities.pdf

Alternatively: Choose any country, but make sure they have 3 causes/effects/solutions you can write about



# Invention
### Remember you have two options:
*look at three problems caused by lack of access to X. For example
**lack of access to healthcare causes unnecessary epidemics
**lack of access to healthcare causes educational issues
**lack of access to (affordable) healthcare causes poverty
*look at three problems that cause lack of access to X
**lack of access to healthcare is caused by corruption
**lack of access to healthcare is caused by lack of roads
**lack of access to healthcare is caused by poverty

### Not all solutions are for individual problems.
For example, lack of water could be solved by:
*providing clean water
*pressuring the government to recognise the slum and provide services.

### Sometimes the causes/effects will go in a circle
*(e.g. lack of access to healthcare causes poverty, and poverty causes lack of access to healthcare)
*Make it very clear in your plan what you are writing about.

# Suggested Thesis Statement
>>"This essay will use the example of TOPIC in CITY/COUNTRY as a case study to illustrate the issues people _dealing with TOPIC/living in TOPIC/ trying to get TOPIC face,_ and some possible solutions for those issues."



# Suggested Topics
## Topic suggestion 1: Slums
### Background
>>Some cities are just not very rich. However, other cities are reasonably wealthy but have very poor areas, with no access to basic services like water, electricity, education. These have various names, such as "slums" or "favelas".

### Discussion
*Do you know any cities which are famous for having a slum?
*Are there slums in Japan? Is there a difference between those and the slums in other countries?

### Link Collection

## Topic Suggestion 2: Access to Basic Education
### Background
Access to education can be limited by gender discrimination, poverty, infrastructure issues, among other causes.

### Link Collection

### Discussion
*What other reasons could there be for lack of access to education?
*What problems does lack of education cause?

### Recommendations
General background: That the problem exists (i.e. background statistics on education)
Importance background: Why education is a good thing  / why lack of education is bad
Specific background: Define "Basic Education"



## Topic Suggestion 3: Access to healthcare
### Background
>>If we get sick, we know we can go to the hospital and get good quality care and medicine, and it will not be too expensive. This is not true for many people around the world. As a result, many people suffer and die from preventable issues. For example, the top three killers in Nigeria are Malaria, respiratory infections, and HIV. These are all cureable or preventable diseases that are still killing people in Nigeria. Why?

### Brainstorm from previous class
*Issues include
**In some areas, basic vaccines are not given
**In some areas, necessary medicines are too expensive
***because companies will not reduce the price
***because the country is poor
***because corrupt officials are using the money for something else
**not enough research because richer countries/people do not have a problem with that disease.
*Medicine is available, but is not getting to the people who need it
**no roads/cars to deliver them
**no fridges to store them in
**conflict - no-one can get in because it is too dangerous
**Political barriers to importing medicine
**Religious objections to certain kinds of treatment


### Recommendations
1) Healthcare is about prevention too. Malaria can be prevented (by nets or education) or cured (with medicine).

2) Be careful: we are looking at the PROBLEMS and SOLUTIONS of what is already a problem (a disease) with solution (education/medicine/hospitals/prevention). The problem is ACCESS to the solution. You are __not__ writing medical research on a cure. You are writing about either
*the SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ETHICAL and TECHNICAL problems with DELIVERING solutions
*the SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, ETHICAL and TECHNICAL problems caused by lack of access to solution

3) You can talk about healthcare in general OR you could focus on one disease.
*"This essay will use the example of COUNTRY as a case study to illustrate the issues people can face when trying to access healthcare, and some possible solutions for those issues."

*"This essay will use the example of DISEASE in COUNTRY as a case study to illustrate the issues people can face when trying to access treatment for DISEASE, and some possible solutions for those issues." IF you choose this option, don't focus too much on one disease - name the main problems and then talk in general about access to hospitals/doctors/education/prevention etc
