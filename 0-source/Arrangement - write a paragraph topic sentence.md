3) Link to the other paragraphs (not always, but often)
*Use "Firstly/Secondly" to show it is part of a series
*Show it is making a similar point e.g. "Another reason..."
*Show it is giving the other side
**"Unlike in the previous paragraph"
**"While above it was argued that X, some people think Y"
4) Say what you want to say about the topic.
5) This is still formal academic English - [[Style - follow academic conventions]]
