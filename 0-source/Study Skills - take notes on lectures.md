## Tips for listening to a lecture
* Prepare:
    * Read the description and the titles.
    * Try to guess what the speaker will say
    * Review what you already know about the topic - read your notes or just think
    * If you have time, read something about the topic, and learn any special vocabulary.
    * If you will have time later and it is important, record the talk on your phone


## What to listen for.
You do not usually quote lectures, so you do not need to copy every word.
* Instead, use lectures to FIND and ORGANISE ideas. Listen for:
* Important links between things.
* Important agreements/disagreements
* Which ideas are old, and which are new
* The lecturer’s attitude to a topic.  (You can disagree, but don’t ignore)
* Structure words so you know where you are in the lecture or if you have missed something
    * First/Next/Finally/In conclusion/Last
    * There are three reasons - A, B, and C
    * Firstly, A
* Important causes and effects
    * X is a result of Y
    * Y, because X
    * X causes Y
* Rhetorical question answers. Usually happens just before summary or overview. After phrases like:
    * So, what happens when ....
    * Now, what do we know about X?  Well.....
    * So, what would be an example of X?  One example would be...
    * What did we learn today? Well,...\
* Important TERMS and DEFINITIONS - write as X = Y
    * X means DEFINITION
    * X, which is DEFINITION
    * X, that is when DEFINITION
    * X, also called Y
* Examples - write as “e.g.”
    * For example
    * A second example is
    * For instance
* Summaries
    * 	The central/main/key point is
    * 	In conclusion / To conclude
    * 	What this means is...
* Important Authors / Books / Articles you should read next
    * You should read
    * You have to look at
* Homework!
    * You need to write
    * Read / Look at / Write

## Taking notes on lectures
* Lectures are too fast and too hard to take 100% English notes
    * Copy only short quotes in English.
    * Take most notes as summary (paraphrase) in Japanese
    * For your RR outline, type up your notes IN ENGLISH
    * For reading log, handwritten Japanese/English notes are OK, but you will present IN ENGLISH, so take a note of any English words you will need
* Lectures are fast - use short-cuts when writing common words. For example
|	"is" 		|	=
|	"is not"	|	≠
|	"causes"	|	--->
|	"number"	|	# 
|	"and"		|	+ 

## Mind maps or Outlines?
|Outlines are better for reading.	|Maps are better for lectures,
|Outlines are easy when you type.	|Maps are easier when you hand-write
|Outlines are good for organised information ///lectures are usually not organised |Maps are better with disorganised informtion ///e.g. if the speaker keeps switching topics
|Outlines are also for PLANNING essays.	|Maps are also good for GETTING IDEAS for essays

## OPTION: Try "Cornell" style
1) Draw the lines as shown (You can buy Cornell notebooks in Loft, there is a template in my folder)
2) Take notes in the right hand box
3) After class/lecture, write keywords to the left
4) After class lecture, write a summary in the middle
5) For my class, dont forget questions +  APA (add them to the summary box.
6) Review: cover the middle and try to remember using the left column
7) For more info, see http://lsc.sas.cornell.edu/Sidebars/Study_Skills_Resources/cornellsystem.pdf
