# Thesis Front Matter overview
Each university/department has its own rules about the first few pages. They often change - especially the order.
### Check your official handbook.
A common combination is:
* Title Page
* Table of Contents
* List of Figures
* List of Tables
* Acknowledgments
* Abstract

# Page 1: Title page.
I will give you an example to follow for your Title Page.

# Page 2: Table of Contents
Use styles for headings, then you can autogenerate.
* This is difficult the first time you do it, but is much easier for long projects.
* Watch http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOjfIjpMTMs

# Page 3: List of Figures
* Diagrams, graphs, maps, photos - anything not a table.
* Use styles for figure captions and you can autogenerate this

# Page 4: List of Tables
* Use styles for table captions and you can autogenerate this

# Page 5: Acknowledgements
* I would like to express my thanks to X for his advice.
* I am particularly grateful to Y for her encouragement.
* I would also like to thank Z for agreeing to participate...
* ...and for their numerous helpful suggestions and comments. Â 

# Abstract
The abstract is basically like the words on the back of a book. It is there to help the reader decide whether or not to read the actual book or download the article.
* Write the abstract LAST.
* Read a few abstracts to get the style.
* APA abstracts should be 150-250 words. You should include:
    * the topic
    * the research question from your INTRO
    * a summary of the RESULTS
    * a summary of your CONCLUSIONS.
    * a quick definition of any unusual terms/acronyms/abbreviations
* You should not include
    * any citations
    * details on your methodology

Do not indent your abstract paragraph
