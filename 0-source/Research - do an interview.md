# Interviews
### Types
* structured (basically like reading out a questionnaire)
* semi-structured (a basic list of questions, but you can ask others).
* unstructured (anything goes)

### Data type
* You can video, audio record or take notes.
* Keep it short - 5 minutes interview is at least 10 minutes typing


# Materials
* Write the questions, roughly
* Pilot it (try it out) with a partners or a small group
* Keep a note of HOW you made these questions.
* This goes in your "Materials" sub-section of your "Methods" section

# Procedure
A summary of the below needs to go in the "Procedure" section of your "Methods" section

## Before the interview
* Make an appointment to meet someone in a quiet place.
* If you are asking about something they do, do the interview soon after.
* Get two recorders. Phones are OK unless they save a strange format (e.g. 3GP). If yours does, ask to borrow my MP3 recorder.
* Test them before you start. Can you hear clearly enough to type it up later?

## At the beginning of the interview
* Offer them a coffee / tea
* Chat for a bit to relax them (SMall Talk!)

### Tell them
* Length of the interview
** ("This interview will last 5 minutes")
** このインタビューは5分かかります
* The purpose of your research
** ("This is for my English class homework")
** これはGCPの課題です
* How anonymous they will be
** ("No-one will know your name")
** あなたの名前は公開しません
* How you will share the data
** ("I will type this up and email you a copy")
** このインタビュー内容をタイピングしてメールであなたにOOOまでに送ります
* They can delete
**  ("If you want to delete anything, let me know")
** 消して欲しい内容があれば教えてください
* Who will see your data
** ("I will show everything to my teacher, and I will share some anonymous quotes in my article/presentation")
** インタビュー内容をすべて先生に見せて、幾つかの回答を匿名でエッセイに引用します
* Ask permission to start
** ("Is it OK to start recording?")
** 録音を始めてもいいですか？

# Start the interview
* There are several types of interview:
** Write the exact questions (a structured interview)
** Write a list of broad questions (a semi-structured interview) **** 
** Write your first question only (an unstructured interview)

* For semi or unstructure interviews, start with a "tour" or a very easy question"
** “Can you tell me a little about”
** “Have you ever”
* For structured interviews, just start reading your main questions


# Useful language for while you are listening
* Backchannel
** はい、ええ、うん (yes)
** そうですか (is that so?)
** ほんとう、ほんと、ほんとに、ほんま (really)
** なるほど (I see)
** 頷き (nodding)
** Uh huh, OK, go on REPEAT / SILENCE / NOD
* PROBE to learn more
** Could you tell me a bit more about
* CHECK if anything is not clear
** When you said X, what did you mean
** What did you mean by X
* MOVE ON to the next main question/topic language
** “Lets move on to”
** “OK, next question”
* REFER BACK to a previous answer
** Earlier, you said there were two reasons. What was the second?

# FINISH the interview
OK, before we finish is there anything else?
質問は以上です。最後に何か言い残したことはありませんか？
Thanks. Do you have any questions? Any comments?
ありがとうございました。何かほかに質問はありませんか？今後のより良い調査のために何かアドバイスをいただけませんか？
OK, I will send you a copy of the transcript by 〇〇. Thank you for your kindness.
では、〇〇日までに今回協力していただいた調査の内容を書面でお送りします。
ご協力ありがとうございました。


# Tips
### DO NOT
* give your own opinion
* Interrupt
* Let them drift off topic
* Agree or disagree
* Say “good”
* Look bored


# After the interview
* Start transcribing and analysing immediately!
* Make notes after the interview on any hunches or problems.
* Send them a thank-you email
* Send them a copy of the transcript and ask for comments
* Send them a copy of the report and invite comments
* Listen to YOUR interview skills – how did you do?
* Ask a friend to check your transcript for mistakes
* Ask a friend to check you transcript for interview skills
* Do a follow-up interview if you have any more questions

# Transcription
Interviews must be converted to text before you can analyse them.
This is called "transcription"

### What should I type?
Transcribe = “to write down exactly what people say”, including:

Repetitions     |I like like dogs better than cats
Fillers         |I um like dogs better than uhh cats
Contractions    |I like dogs better’n cats
Mistakes        |I likes dogs more better than cats
Restarts        |I like dogs/I like dogs better than cats
Truncations     |I li- like dogs better than cats
Pauses          |I like … cats better than …dogs
Missing bits    |I like [inaudible] better than cats
Uncertain bits  |I like [?]
Other bits      |I like [loud noise from kitchen] …uh hold on
Emphasis        |I like __cats__ but not dogs

Some research types (Discourse analysis, conversation analysis) also mark:
Pause length    |I like  [:5] cats better than dog
Non-verbal      |I like [scratches nose] cats better than dog
Overlaps        |A: I like dogs.     [And I like cats]///
                |B:-_________________[How about cats.] Oh you do? Me too

### Pseudonyms
* Ask each subject to choose pseudonym (a fake name to protect their identity but which is nicer than calling them “S1”).
* Try to keep it in the same gender and ethnic group (Hiroko should choose something like "Miyuki", not "George")

### Numbering
Each line needs to have the student's pseudonym ("Bob") and a line number (1,2,3), because otherwise when you do a cut and sort analysis you won't know what comes from where.
Check the Shared Materials Folder for the transcription blank



### Tips
* Use a computer, notyour phone
* Learn keyboard shortcuts for pausing your audio and switching from player to Word
* Keep backups and don’t lose private data.
* Punctuate for sound, not grammar
** a question mark = rising intonation
** a comma = a pause
