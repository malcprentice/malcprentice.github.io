# What are the rules for using keywords?
## 1) Use the right word type
Keywords need to be used again later, and need to be easy to fit into other sentences.
Some word types don't work easily this way.

### These do not work:
Adjectives don't work: ~~"Secondly, happy."~~
Normal verbs don't work: ~~"Secondly, run."~~

### These are best:
Nouns 				|"Secondly, pollution"
Noun phrases 		|"Secondly, lack of pollution"

### These usually work:
ING verbs	 			|"Secondly, participating"
ING verb phrases		|"Secondly, increasing participation"
question word phrases 	|"Secondly, how to increase participation"


### If in doubt:
* just use nounsor a short (2-4 word) phrase that ends in a noun
** "pollution, child labour, and conflict"
** "harmful air pollution, widespread child labour, and conflict between religious groups"

## 2) Keywords MUST MATCH
Don't mix the types!
* OK: preparation, cooking, and decoration.
* OK: preparing, cooking, and decorating.
* OK: prepare, cook and decorate.
* OK: how to prepare, how to cook, and how to decorate
* NO: <red>how to</red> prepare, cook<red>ing</red>, and decora<red>tion</red>

## 3) Use list rules
See [[Style - use lists]].
Be careful with commas and "and"
* 1, 2, 3<blue>, and</blue> 4.
* 1, 2, 3<red>, </red> 4.

# When do I use keyword rules?
## In an essay
Link your thesis statement, your paragraphs, and your conclusion with keywords
See [[Style - use cohesion]]
+ "This essay first looks at X in terms of  A, B, and C"
+ "This paragraph describes A"
+ "This paragraph outlines B"
+ "This paragraph covers C"
+ "This essay looked at X. In summary A, B, C."



### Your Thesis statement needs one keyword per BODY PARAGRAPH
* See [[Arrangement - write an introduction thesis statement]]
** e.g. "This essay....description....problem....solution"
** e.g. "This paragraph...similarities...differences"
** e.g. "This paragraph looks at three problems penguins are facing: global warming, poaching, and a lack of onigiri"
* A 5 para essay needs 3 keywords
* Some teachers call Keywords for paragraphs "Controlling aspects" or "Controlling ideas"
* Note that if you need to [[Arrangement - write a sectional essay]], the rules are slightly different

### Your Topic Sentence needs one keyword for each IDEA.
See [[Arrangement - write a paragraph topic sentence]]
* "This paragraph looks at three problems Borneo Orangutans face: deforestation, climate change, and forest fires"
* "This paragraph looks at three problems paper production causes - deforestation, climate change, and forest fires"

## In lists
See [[Style - use lists]]
* Any time you make a list, follow the keyword rules
* "There are three kinds of X: A, B, and C."
