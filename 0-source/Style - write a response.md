*For readings
**Use "author" for someone you read.
**Use "book" or "article" for the thing.
**Use "read" as he verb (After reading / After I read)
*For lectures
**Use "speaker" for someone you heard.
**Use "lecture" or "talk" for the thing.
**Use "watched" or "saw" as verbs (After watching / After I watched)
*For songs
**Use "singer/band"
**Use "song"
**Use "listened to" as he verb (After I listened to)
