#What is a "parenthical"
They help you give extra information in the MIDDLE of a sentence. For example: 

*Cats are cute.
*Cats <blue>(a common pet)</blue> are cute


#How do I use them?
###There are three ways:
*Hyphens

*Cats <blue>-</blue> a common pet <blue>-</blue> are cute.
*Cats <blue>(</blue>a common pet<blue>)</blue> are cute.
*Cats<blue>,</blue> a common pet<blue>,</blue> are cute.
