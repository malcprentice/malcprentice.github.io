# Aim
By the end of this page, you will know
* What participation points are and how to get them
* How to manage your own study outside of class

# What are participation points?
* You WIN points mostly by doing extra work and trying new things
* You LOSE points mostly by missing work/class 
* There are many ways to score points 
* YOU choose how to get participation points



# Option 1: Score "try it" points
* Try useful things around the university
* Maximum one point each!
* See "Participation Plan Template" for screenshot examples. Follow carefully.

__Some rules__
* Don't attend a Global Village where that language is your first language!
* If Japanese is not your first language, ask me about Nihongo Dojo
* No points for office hours after mid term. I want you to ask a question, not scramble for a last-minute point. 
* <red>If TOEIC is required </red>
** (e.g. I'm giving you 5%, or another teacher is requiring it)
** then to get the "try it" point, you would need to do ANOTHER test and send TWO screenshots (required+extra)]


# Option 2: Do extra quickwrites
* Wait until I teach how to [[Study Skills - do a quickwrite]] in class
* You get points for doing MORE than the minimum (25)
** 1 point for each 3 EXTRA quickwrites
** 5 points max for EXTRA quickwrites
** <red>Usually,</red> 25 NORMAL + 15 EXTRA = maximum 40 TOTAL for 5 participation points
** <red> In 2020</red>, 25 normal + 30 extra = maximum 55 total for 10 participation points. 
* All quickwrites, minimum or extra, must be > minimum word count


# How to lose participation points (aka NG points)
If you do these things, you aren't participating:
* Being absent (-1 point)
* Being late (-0.5 points)
* Forgetting homework we need for class
* Submitting ungraded homework late
* Sleeping in class after a warning
* Using too much Japanese in class after a warning
* Using phone in class after warning
** dictionary, research, showing photo of your dog OK
** reading email, Line, etc not OK

<red> Online 2020: </red> email if you have a technical problem. 
* No email + late to Zoom = late. 
* Email + late to Zoom = OK.

# To avoid forgetting homework or running out of time:
* [[Study Skills - set goals]]
* [[Study Skills - manage time]]
* [[Study Skills - stay motivated]]


# Homework 
* Read everything above
* Make a plan that gets you 10 points
** e.g.  "15 extra quickwrites (5 points), plus 1 for EF, 1 for  WC, 1 for  GV, 1 for  ALC, and 1 for  for the official TOEIC test"
** e.g.  "30 extra quickwrites" (30 allowed in 2020, but usually max 15)
* You can change your plan later 
** e.g. "I hate ALC - I'm going to do more EF instead"
** e.g. "I was absent (-1), so I will do 18 quickwrites instead of 15 (+1)"
* Submit your "Participation Plan Template" for checking, then again at end of semester for grading
