# Aim
By the end of this page, you will know
* What participation points are and how to get them
* How to manage your own study outside of class

# What are participation points?
* You WIN points mostly by doing extra work and trying new things
* You LOSE points mostly by missing homework/class 
* There are at least 18 possible points. Just choose 10!
* If you're absent or late, do more than 10 to get lost points back.
* TO get points, post a photo of the proof into your Google Classroom "Participation Plan"

# Option 1: Score "try it" points 
* Try useful things around the university
* Maximum one point each!
* See "Participation Plan Template" for screenshot examples. Follow carefully.

__Some rules__
* Is Japanese your second language? Nihongo Dojo is also 1 point. No point for GV in your own language though!
* No points for office hours after mid term. It's for asking question, not scrambling for last-minute point. 
* No points for ECR - not enough staff. Only go if you have an actual question
* See [[Study Skills - use the Self Access Centre]] for information on each centre


# Option 2: Do extra quickwrites (max 5 points)
* Wait until I teach how to [[Study Skills - do a quickwrite]] in class
* You get points for doing MORE than the minimum (25)
** 1 point for each 3 EXTRA quickwrites
** 5 points max for EXTRA quickwrites
* All quickwrites, minimum or extra, must be > minimum word count


# Option 3: Official TOEIC or TOEFL test (max 3 points)
* <red>If TOEIC is required</red>
** (e.g. I'm giving you 5%, or another teacher is requiring it)
** Then, you can't get participation points for a required test
** To get participation points, do a SECOND test (TOEIC or TOEFL) and submit TWO screenshots

* If TOEIC is NOT required:
** I'll give you <red>3</red> participation points for doing it. 

In either case, prove it using screenshot(s) in your participation plan, showing name and date. 


# Option 4: ALC Net Academy (max 5 points)
* See [[Study Skills - use ALC NetAcademy]]    
* <red>New 2020 Fall</red> low scores (<30%) and unrealistic "time needed" are not accepted. Put some effort in or you won't get the point! 


# How to lose participation points (aka NG points)
If you do these things, you aren't participating:
* Being absent (-1 point)
* Being late (-0.5 points)
* Forgetting homework we need for class
* Submitting ungraded homework late
* Sleeping in class after a warning
* Using too much Japanese in class after a warning
* Using phone in class after warning
** dictionary, research, showing photo of your dog OK
** reading email, Line, etc not OK

<red> Online 2020: </red> email if you have a technical problem. 
* No email + late to Zoom = late. 
* Email + late to Zoom = OK.

# To avoid forgetting homework or running out of time:
* [[Study Skills - set goals]]
* [[Study Skills - manage time]]
* [[Study Skills - stay motivated]]


# Homework 
* Read everything above
* Make a plan that gets you 10 points
** e.g.  "15 extra quickwrites (5 points), plus 1 for EF, 1 for  WC, 1 for  GV, 1 for  ALC, and 1 for  for the official TOEIC test"
** e.g.  "30 extra quickwrites" (30 allowed in 2020, but usually max 15)
* You can change your plan later 
** e.g. "I hate ALC - I'm going to do more EF instead"
** e.g. "I was absent (-1), so I will do 18 quickwrites instead of 15 (+1)"
* Submit your "Participation Plan Template" for checking, then again at end of semester for grading
