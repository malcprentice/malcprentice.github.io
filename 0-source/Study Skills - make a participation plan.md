* What participation points are and how to get them
* How to manage your own study outside of class

# What are participation points?

* You LOSE points mostly by missing work/class 
* There are many ways to score points 
* YOU choose how to get participation points
* Not everything is available online. Read <red>Online 2020 </red> notes

# Option 1: Score "try it" points
* Try useful things around the university
* Maximum one point each!

__Some rules__
* Don't attend a Global Village where that language is your first language!
* If Japanese is not your first language, ask me about Nihongo Dojo
* I might change the maximum points for each thing above - I will tell you in class if I do


# Option 2: WLC/SAC/University events 
<red> Online 2020 - none available online so far</red>
* ALL WLC SAC events score a point. 
** To get a point, show me the event stamp 
** Event stamps are on the BACK of your EF sheet
** Examples include:
*** GLS (Global Lecture Series, once a term)
*** WLC SAC Festival (Fall)
*** Game Jam (occasional)
*** Drama workshop (occasional)
*** Other OK, but check with me first that it is WLC
* For other university English events, I PROBABLY give points:
** ASK me first so I can decide if it is worth a point 
** I will tell you how you can prove you participated well

# Option 3: Do extra quickwrites
<red>Online 2020: Your other options are limited I'll allow more quickwrite points</red>
* Wait until I teach how to [[Study Skills - do a quickwrite]] in class
* You get points for doing MORE than the minimum (25)
** 1 point for each 3 EXTRA quickwrites
** 5 points max for EXTRA quickwrites
** (5x3= 15 EXTRA quickwrite maximum)
** Usually, 25 NORMAL + 15 EXTRA = maximum 40 TOTAL
** <red> Spring 2020, 25 normal + 30 extra = maximum 55 total for 10 participation points. </red>
* All quickwrites, minimum or extra, must be > minimum word count

# Option 4: ALC Net Academy
* See [[Study Skills - use ALC NetAcademy]]
* Maximum 5 points

# How to lose points
<red> Online 2020: Lose a point if a) submit homework late or b) miss a Zoom class (but it's OK if you email me before deadline or during class if you have a problem)</red>
* If you don't attend, you aren't participating 
** Being absent (-1 point)
** Being late (-0.5 points)
** Max is -7 points, because more than that and you fail the course anyway
* NG point (-1, no max)
** Forget homework in class, not even in Drive
** Homework (essay draft) submitted late online
** Missing homework at end of term e.g. only 22 QW
** Sleeping in class after a warning
** Talking too much Japanese in class after a warning
** Using phone in class after warning
*** dictionary, research, OK
*** reading email etc not OK


### To avoid forgetting homework or running out of time:
* [[Study Skills - set goals]]
* [[Study Skills - manage time]]
* [[Study Skills - stay motivated]]


# Homework 
* Read everything above
* Make a plan that gets you 10 points
** e.g. "I will do 15 extra quickwrites (5 points), plus EF, WC, GV, Office, and ALC (5 points)"
** e.g. "We are online, so I just plan to do 30 extra quickwrites"
** e.g. "We are online, so I will use ALC (2 full tests, 1 half tests = 5 points), one Office hour (1 point), and 12 extra QW (4 points). 
* If you lose a point, change your plan e.g. "I submitted my essay late and lost a point, so I will now need to do 15 quickwrites instead of 12"
* If you change your mind, change your plan e.g. "I hate ALC - I'm going to do more EF instead"
* Be ready to show me your plan when I ask
