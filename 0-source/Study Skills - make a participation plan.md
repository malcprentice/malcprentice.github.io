# Aim
By the end of this page, you will know
* What participation points are and how to get them
* How to manage your own study outside of class

# Task
Please read the page, and do the homework at the bottom

# What are participation points?
* First, check what your syllabus says about participation
* You get points mostly by doing extra work
* You lose them mostly by missing work 
* There are many ways to score points 
* YOU choose how to score the maximum 
* ANY combination of Option 1, 2, and 3 OK
* Remember you can also LOSE points 


# Option 1: Score "try it" points
Try useful things around the university
Maximum one point each!
<red>If we are online after May 11, only "ALC" and "Office hour" are available in this section. See the note at the bottom.</red>

__Some rules__
* Don't attend a Global Village where that language is your first language!
* If Japanese is not your first language, ask me about Nihongo Dojo
* I might change the maximum points for each thing above - I will tell you in class if I do


# Option 2: WLC/SAC/University events 
<red> IF we are online after May 11, none of these are available</red>
* ALL WLC SAC events score a point. 
** To get a point, show me the event stamp 
** Event stamps are on the BACK of your EF sheet
** Examples include:
*** GLS (Global Lecture Series, once a term)
*** WLC SAC Festival (Fall)
*** Game Jam (occasional)
*** Drama workshop (occasional)
*** Other OK, but check with me first that it is WLC
* For other university English events, I PROBABLY give points:
** ASK me first so I can decide if it is worth a point 
** I will tell you how you can prove you participated well

# Option 3: Do extra quickwrites
<red>If we are online after May 11, you can still do these. I will increase the maximum</red>
* If you don't know what this is:
** Don't worry!
** I will explain how to [[Study Skills - do a quickwrite]] later
** Maybe class 2, 3, or 4, depending. 
* You only get points for doing MORE than the minimum
** minimum = 25 NORMAL quickwrites for class
** 1 point for each 3 EXTRA quickwrites
** 5 points max for EXTRA quickwrites
** (5x3= 15 EXTRA quickwrite maximum)
** (25 NORMAL + 15 EXTRA = maximum 40 TOTAL)
* All quickwrites, minimum or extra, must be long enough
* No extra points for other homework (SR, Vocab), just QW

# How to lose points
<red> If we stay online after May 11, the only way to lose points is to submit homework late. If we use Zoom, I'll tell you the attendance rules for that later</red>
* If you don't attend, you aren't participating 
** Being absent (-1 point)
** Being late (-0.5 points)
** Max is -7 points, because more than that and you fail the course anyway
* NG point (-1, no max)
** Forget homework in class, not even in Drive
** Homework (essay draft) submitted late online
** Missing homework at end of term e.g. only 22 QW
** Sleeping in class after a warning
** Talking too much Japanese in class after a warning
** Using phone in class after warning
*** dictionary, research, OK
*** reading email etc not OK


## To avoid this, try reading these:
* [[Study Skills - manage time]]
* [[Study Skills - set goals]]
* [[Study Skills - stay motivated]]



# <red>IF WE ARE STILL LEARNING ONLINE AFTER MAY 11</red>
Only three things are possible online, so if we are online after May 11, choose how to score your 10 participation points from here:
* 1) [[Study Skills - use ALC NetAcademy]] 
** 2 points for full size test
** 1 point for half size test
** max 5 points total
** (send a screenshot of your test results)
* 2) "Attend Malc's office hour" 
** No schedule - just email for an appointment. Tell me if you want Zoom, Hangouts, or something else
** Max 1 point (you can attend as much as you want, but you only get 1 point for trying it out the first time)
* 3) [[Study Skills - do a quickwrite]]
** No change to instructions, but
** Max points now 10


# Homework 
* Read everything above
* Make a plan that gets you 10 points
** e.g. "I will do 15 extra quickwrites (5 points), plus EF, WC, GV, Office, and ALC (5 points)"
** e.g. "We are online, so I just plan to do 30 extra quickwrites"
** e.g. "We are online, so I will use ALC (2 full tests, 1 half tests = 5 points), one Office hour (1 point), and 12 extra QW (4 points). 
* If you lose a point, change your plan e.g. "I submitted my essay late and lost a point, so I will now need to do 15 quickwrites instead of 12"
* If you change your mind, change your plan e.g. "I hate ALC - I'm going to do more EF instead"
* Be ready to show me your plan when I ask
