# What is a quickwrite?
Quickwrite = How many words can your write in 10 minutes?
* Quantity not quality! 
* Easy topics! 
* Don't worry about spelling or grammr. Only speed!

If you answered  "Yes and no - my keyboard is small and it's hard to type" on the survey:
* Read "Can't type?" below. 
* Ignore the template. Handwriting is OK too. 

# Aim
The aim is to help you:
* Write quickly in English
* Think quickly in English 
* Turn words you UNDERSTAND into words you can USE
* Improve exam scores for writing (e.g. iBT TOEFL)
* practice some [[Resources - paragraph basics]]
* If you have a keyboard and can type, then also:
** improve typing speed
** learn how to use templates or [[Study Skills - format written work]]

# How to do a quickwrite
<img src="https://openclipart.org/download/104017/chronometre.svg" />

## 1) Find the template online
* Go to Google Classroom
** Find "Regular Homework - Quickwrites"
** Find "Template for QW" 
** This is YOUR copy - you can edit it. 
* Rename the document 
** "Name - Class - Quickwrites"
** e.g. "Hiroko Sato - ECS - Quickwrites"
* Open the document
** Change your name, number, class in top right
** (your name is not Hiroko Sato!)

### Don't worry about formatting! 
* Just use the template! It has correct font, size, etc. 
* Broke the template? Fix these things: [[Study Skills - format written work]]


### Can't type? 
If you can't type e.g. only have phone, small keyboard
* use pen and paper
* use B5 size paper or bigger
* Don't lose your QW! Put them in a folder 
* I will check later by photo
You can use handwriting


## 2) Choose a topic 
* Choose a topic from here: [[Resources - quickwrite topics]]
* Any topic, any order OK. But start easy (at top)
* Add the title to your document 
** Where it says "QW1: Title of Quickwrite"
** Change it to e.g. "QW1: What I do in my Spare Time"
** Should be left aligned (左揃え)
** Should [[Style - use title case]]
** If the title is > 12 words, shorten it

## 3) Get Ready
* Set a timer for 10 minutes
* THINK (no writing) for 1 minute about the topic 


## 4) Go!
* Start your 10 minute timer
* Start writing
* No stopping! No dictionaries!
* Don’t worry about grammar or spelling!
* Do try to follow [[Resources - paragraph basics]] though
* Change the topic if you need to 
** For example if the topic is "last holiday"
** You can change it to "holiday in JHS" or "next holiday" 
** Only if you have no more ideas

## 5) After 10 minutes, STOP and count words
* Use "Word Count" under "Tools"
* Do not count name/title!
* Take a note of your word count
* If are under the minimum word count (below):
** keep going until you hit the minimum
** Record both numbers on your quickwrite:
** e.g. "103 words finally (88 words in 10 minutes)"

## Minimum Word Count
If you do less than the following, you have NOT done your homework.

|Time            		|SSB/ECS/EITC		|GCP
|--------------------	|------------------ |---------
|QW 1-10         		|100 words minimum	|100
|QW 11-20        		|150 words minimum	|150
|QW 21-40        		|175 words minimum	|200
|QW 1-10 (Fall)  		|175 words minimum	|200
|QW 11-20        		|200 words minimum	|250
|QW 21-40        		|225 words minimum	|300

# Assessment
## Homework every week
* Don't submit, don't email! 
* Just keep adding (QW2, QW3, ...) to document
* I will check QW1
* I will check again after QW10

## In class every week:
* Switch and read your partners QW. Discuss.
* I will check your QW for the day:
** Missing homework = -1 participation points
** Under the minimum word count = -1 participation points
* If we are online after May 11 - I'm still thinking how to do this. 

# At the end of the course 
* I will check how many QW you did
* Under the minimum  = lose participation points
* More than the minimum = get participation points
* (You will make a "Participation Plan" later to check this)
* Submit QW1-QW25/QW40 __on Google Classroom__
** <green>Just click submit!</green>
** __Don't__ email anything! 
** __Don't__ upload a new document! 
** This is <red>NOT</red> "課題を提出する" style
** This is "自分に割り当てられたドキュメントがある課題を提出する"/"assigned document" style
** Not clear? Read the Japanese https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6020285?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=ja or English https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6020285?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en instructions





# Having problems?
If your QW is too short, or you're taking a long time to hit the minimum, then:
* A) Plan your quickwrite more carefully before you start. Take an extra minute to get your ideas ready
* B) Relax!
** I'm not checking these
** I want quantity not quality.
** Care less about your spelling and grammar - we will work on that in the essay project.
* C) Improve your typing
** Take an online test. Japanese OK. If you are under 200 wpm, your problem is typing skill, not English. If so:
** First take lessons so you don't get bad habits. For example: http://typingclub.com/
** Next, practice for speed by zapping aliens: http://phoboslab.org/ztype/
** Beat my high score at the Alien game (2042) and take a screenshot - I will give you a bonus point!
