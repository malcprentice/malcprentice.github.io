# Aim
The aim of quickwrites is to help you:
* Write quickly in English
* Think quickly in English 
* Practice formatting written work
** Meet "Title Case"
** Practice paragraph basics
* Turn words you UNDERSTAND into words you can USE
* Improve your scores on exams with writing (e.g. iBT TOEFL)
* Practice typing speed (for exams and life)


# How to do a quickwrite
<img src="https://openclipart.org/download/104017/chronometre.svg" />

## 1) Find the template online
a) Find "Template for QW" on Google Classroom
b) Rename the document 
* name-class-quickwrites
* e.g. "Hiroko Sato - ECS - Quickwrites"
c) Open the document
* Change your name, number, class in top right
* (your name is not Hiroko Sato!)
* Don't worry about formatting! Just use the template! However, if you break the template, instructions are here: [[Study Skills - format written work]]


###Can't type?
e.g. online 2020, typing on phone
* If you can't type
** use B5 size paper or bigger
** Don't lose your quickwrites! 
** Keep them together in a folder! 
** I will check later!


##2) Choose a topic 
* Choose a topic: [[Resources - quickwrite topics]]
* Any topic in any order is OK, but start easy (top)
* Add the title to your document 
** Where it says "QW1: Title of Quickwrite"
** Change it to e.g. "QW1: What I do in my Spare Time"
** Should be left aligned (左揃え)
** Should [[Style - use title case]]
** If the title is > 12 words, shorten it

##3) Get Ready
* Set a timer for 10 minutes
* Before you start, THINK for 1 minute about the topic 


###4) Go!
* Start your 10 minute timer
* Start writing
* No stopping! No dictionaries!
* Don’t worry about grammar or spelling!
* Do try to follow [[Resources - paragraph basics]] though
* Change the topic if you need to 
** For example if the topic is "last holiday
** You can change it to "holiday in JHS" or "next holiday" 
** Only if you have no more ideas

### 3) After 10 minutes, STOP and count your words
* Use "Word Count"
* Do not count name/title!
* Add your word count to your progress chart
* If your word count is under the minumum, keep going:
** keep going until you hit the minimum (below)
** Record both numbers:
** e.g. "103 words (88 words in 10 minutes)"

# Minimum Word Count
If you do less than the following, you have NOT done your homework.

|Time            		|Typed C/D			|Typed GCP
|--------------------	|------------------ |---------
|QW 1-10         		|100 words minimum	|100
|QW 11-20        		|150 words minimum	|150
|QW 21-43        		|200 words minimum	|200
|QW 1-10 (Fall)  		|200 words minimum	|200
|QW 11-20        		|225 words minimum	|250
|QW 21-43        		|250 words minimum	|300




### 4) If typed
* Keep all your QW in ONE document (your template)
* I will tell you how to do this in a later class

### 5) In class we will:
* Switch and read your partners QW. Discuss
* I will check you met the minimum length
* Under the minimum word count: <red>NG</red> stamp

### 6)At the end of the course - assessment
* I will check your QW
* Under the minimum for the term: - participation points
* More than the minimum for the term: + participation points
* (You will make a "Participation PLan" later to check this)

# Having problems?
If your QW is too short, or you're taking a long time to hit the minimum, then:
* A) Plan your quickwrite more carefully before you start. Take an extra minute to get your ideas ready
* B) Relax!
** I'm not checking these
** I want quantity not quality.
** Care less about your spelling and grammar - we will work on that in the essay project.
* C) Improve your typing
** Take an online test. Japanese OK. If you are under 200 wpm, your problem is typing skill, not English. If so:
** First take lessons so you don't get bad habits. For example: http://typingclub.com/
** Next, practice for speed by zapping aliens: http://phoboslab.org/ztype/
** Beat my high score at the Alien game (2042) and take a screenshot - I will give you a bonus point!
