# Principles of Question Writing
Can you match any of the above questions to the problems below?
*Don't use words your participant doesn't know.
*Avoid double questions
*Don't ask participants to guess what other people might think
*Don't ask participants about topics they don't know
*No double negatives
*Be careful with embarassing questions
*Be careful with questions where participant might want to impress or give "right" answer
**“How many books have you read?”
**“How many have you had time to read?”   
*Be careful with multiple choice - they need to cover everything and not overlap
*Avoid loaded questions (questions with no escape - a "bang" in both ends)
*Avoid leading questions (questions that show what answer you want)
*Add check questions “How many books did you read last week?”

# Types of questions
*OPEN questions
**(When you don’t know what people do or how they will answer)
**e.g. What is your favourite band?
*CLOSED questions
**(when it is yes/no, or a small range of choice)
**e.g. Do you prefer salmon or tuna?
**How many/how often/where/when + abcd choice
