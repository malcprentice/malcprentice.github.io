+Introduction and Literature Review
++Presentation opening ("Today, we would like to talk about a survey research project we did recently")
++General background on topic (e.g "Many students")
++Specific background ("One of the...")
++Definition if necessary
++Importance background ("This is important because")
++Thesis statement
+++FOr research, thesis statement = Research Question 
+++(e.g. "This research project aims to discover....")
+Methods
++Research Framework 
+++(e.g. "This is a piece of qualitative research...etc")
+++see [[Style - write a research methods section]]
++Participants and Context 
+++(e.g. "We each interviewed one classmate, for a total of...")
+++see [[Style - write a research methods section]]
++Materials 
+++How did you MAKE the questions
+++(e.g. write---pilot--change-- etc.)
++Procedure 
+++How did you USE the questions?
+++Step by step instructions so next year can copy.

++Analysis
++Step by step instructions so next year can copy.
++Was any data dropped? Why?
++Were there any issues?
++see [[Style - write a research methods section]]
+Results
++Topic sentence 
+++for writing: This section describes results of interviews.
+++for speech ("So what were the results")
++See [[Style - write a research results section]]
+Discussion 
++Topic sentence 
+++(In writing, we soul start "This section..."
+++for speech try "So what did we find out?"
+++See [[Style - write a research discussion section]]
++Summary of results 
+++e.g. ("In conclusion, the main findings were 1,2, and 3."
+++"In conclusion, six out of ten students interviewed said yes when asked if they liked penguins. For those that said yes..... For those that said “no”...".)

++Implications 
+++(e.g. "As such, if a university student / a university /a wants to help, they should..." 
+++(WARNING if the interview question asks for recommendations, they will be in the summary – drop this)
+++See [[Style - write a research discussion section]]
++Limitations and suggestions for future research
+++e.g. "This project had some limitations, in that" (e.g. not enough participants, sampling)
+++"Future research should aim to determine X")
+++See [[Style - write a research discussion section]]
++Conclusion/Final comment
+++you have already made a recommendation of these above, so perhaps instead make a general prediction
+++e.g. "If X follow these recommendations, hopefully Y will Z")
