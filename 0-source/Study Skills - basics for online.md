Hello! Welcome to the course.
This page is to help you find the main class page and say hello.

Try to read this is in English, but remember if you get stuck that Google Translate is not very good, but it can help: https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=ja&u=http%3A%2F%2Falba-english.org%2Findex.html

# In this course:
* First we will do a few things to prepare to learn online (until May 11). 
* Then we will start a project: 
** You will read and listen to some English
** You will learn to write essays
** You will (maybe) try some presentations later. 
** We will also learn new words, and practice reading and writing more quickly. 

# The next 3-4 "classes" are very simple:
* Task 1: 		This task, below 
* Task 2:		"Say Hello!"
* Task 3:  	Read your syllabus (what your homework is, what your deadlines are, etc).
* Task 4-6: 	Learn to do your regular weekly homework
* Task 7: 		Start your first essay project

# Asking for help
* If you have problems, email me, any time! If you don't already know my email address (from the syllabus), <a href="mailto:notmyrealaddressjustaspamfilter@alba-english.com">use this backup address</a>
* Before you email, maybe review how to [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]]
* After we're on campus, you come to office hours - check my schedule ( [[Schedules - Malc's schedule]] ) and book an office hour appointment. 
* However, while we're online, email, or email and make a Zoom appointment.  
* You can also contact me on Google Classroom. You will learn how for homework.
