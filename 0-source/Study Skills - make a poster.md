A POSTER is a special kind of presentation done at conferences. You put up your poster in a room with other posters, and people visit. 
Here is an example: https://blogit.itu.dk/ethos/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2016/03/8-06SRSOverview.jpg



# Preparation
### Decide what kind of template you need
    * A0 or A1? Landscape or Portrait?
    * Research, Descriptive, or Artistic?
    * How many columns?

### Decide if it is a STAND-BESIDE or a STAND-ALONE poster
* STAND-BESIDE
    * Posters stay up for about an hour (lunchtime, break, special session)
    * You stand near it all that time, then take it down
    * Posters focus on keywords, figures (images, charts, etc).
    * Don't steal images! Use these [[Resources - sources of free images and clipart]]
    * Fonts are larger
    * No one will read the poster when you are not there.
    * Visitors will read it for about 30 seconds, then ask you a question.
    * Often arranged artistically
* STAND-ALONE
    * Posters stay up for 1-2 days
    * You only stand beside the poster for a short time.
    * Posters can have more text
    * Fonts can be smaller
    * Most people will read the poster when you are not there.
    * Your job is to give EXTRA info when you're there.
    * Visitors will read it for 2-3 minutes.
    * Often arranged in a "rombun" pattern (Intro, Background, Methods, Results, Discussion, Reference)

* Use a scientific format, or be more creative (as long as it is clear)

### Classroom examples and templates
See materials folder

### General rules. 
* Sizes
    * The normal size is A0 or A1
    * Check before you make it "landscape" - not all conferences have wide boards

# Delivery
## Fonts for posters
* Sans-serif (e.g. Arial) only. No Times New Roman.
* Title should be 90-200pt
    * You should be able to read the section headings from about 2 meters away (36-54pt)
    * You should be able to read the text easily from about 1 meter away (24-36pt)
    * Stand-alone poster fons can go a little smaller - people stand closer..
    * ...but no smaller than 18 point, and only if absolutely necessary
    * Formal Section headings: use __Bold Title Case__


## Software for posters
* Powerpoint is standard for templates
* Pages (Mac), Keynote(Mac), and Google Slides work in a pinch
* Pros use Adobe Illustrator, InDesign, or Photoshop, but only if you want to spend an hour googling "CMYK mode" and "bleeds"
* Choose the right page size
    * Use one large A0 /A1 size slide for professional work
    * Use multiple A4 slides for classroom posters. 
* Be careful with images
    * Take screenshots on a computer with a BIG monitor.
    * Download LARGE images
    * Zoom in to 150%. Is it fuzzy? Get a better image
    * If it's not your image, cite the source!
    * Keep figures simple - no shadows, 3D, grids
    * Make sure the labels in tables/figures are also big enough to read
 
## Printing posters
* Only PDFs are font-safe and universally accepted
    * "Export" to a high-quality PDF for printing
    * Don't worry if the PDF preview images look blurry - they might be too good for your preview software.
* Both glossy and matte look fine
* Paper weight
    * Choose a thicker paper if possible
    * more than 150 GSM (grams per square metre) becomes a bit springy and annoying
* International conference?
    * If you have a spare day before the conference, print shops overseas are often cheaper and faster
    * No need for fancy poster tubes - print shops have cheap/free tubes


## Extras
Make it easy to go beyond the poster
* QR codes: emails and website addresses
* Goo.gl: shorten long links for those without QR scanners
* Handout: data, references, errors, contact



# Style and Arrangement: Language for posters
* Note ENglish: keywords, not sentences. 
* People usually spend a maximum 1 minute reading a poster. Then they ask a question or walk on. 
    * For stand-beside posters: Title, headings, bullet points, and figures only (anything else is wasted) 
    * For stand-alone: you need more (but keep it short). Stick a folder with handouts under the poster for more
* There should be a clear flow. Don't make me guess which section is next. Options include:
    * Top to bottom (one or two columns)
    * Left to right (one or two rows)
    * Central image surrounded by additional information
* Otherwise, follow the style guide in the other sheet


# Other tips
* Have a friend proof-read it. 
* If it's a professional poster, print a full size draft on cheap paper to check images
* Are you going to be carrying your poster? Get a tube or poster holder
* Are you going to be printing your poster at the conference? Book ahead or make sure you have enough time.

* Before you pounce on someone reading your poster, give them time to read
* Make sure you know how to attach it to the wall/board!
    * For classroom posters, I will bring magnets
    * For conferences, take tape. Blu-tack, pins, magnets may not work.

# Classroom posters
* Print A4 Powerpoint slides
* Slide count 9 or 12 is best
    * grids will look better (3x3, 3x4)
    * or title at top, followed by grid.
* One slide per paragraph, or one slide per point
* Title and References slide necessary. Overview optional
* These are "Stand-beside" style posters, so large fonts, no paragraphs, lots of images
* Colour is better
* Sticking them to an coloured A1 sheet will make it look better
* Don’t forget tape/magnets
* Don’t forget a “NOTES” copy with your extra information, answers to questions
