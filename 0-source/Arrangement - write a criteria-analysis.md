One common report you might be asked to do when you start work is a criteria-analysis
For example, when the university made GLobal Square, they had to buy hundreds of projectors. 
How did they choose from the many available? 
Probably, someone was asked to 
1) Choose criteria (bright, cheap, reliable,)
2) Get information on many projectors
3) Narrow it down to a few
4) Write a report recommending ONE projector, with reasons. 


# Invention
* For topics, think about:
    * Something you need to buy (mobile phone)
    * Something you need to choose (study abroad, company)
    * Something Japan needs to decide (olympic stadium designs)

* For criteria:
    * DON'T choose boring criteria (e.g. cost) 
    * choose something that needs research
    * choose something that needs thought

# Examples
* make sure you have the correct arrangement
* one thing = colunteer, three things = robot

# Arrangement - Overview
There are two basic types
* Analyse ONE thing and give a yes/no recommendation
* Analyse THREE things and recommend the best choice 
* The GCP Volunteer example use "ONE thing" arrangement
* The Engineering Robot example use "THREE things" arrangement

* FYI: "Figure" = image/map/graph

# Arrangement for slides
* There is a Powerpoint TEMPLATE in the template folder 
* (TEMPLATE for criteria-analysis presentation.pptx)

### 12 slide pattern
+ Title Slides
+ Overview slide
    + This is equivalent to your Intro paragraph
    + SPEAK your GB, SB, IB 
    + SPEAK your thesis statement, don't write it
    + Bullet points for your three criteria and your analysis target(s)
    + A good figure
+ Optional slide: Description 
    + (if you need more space for description)
    + general topic only: definition, partition, comparison, process

# Arrangement for Essay
* There is no outline template
    * Just use your powerpoint as a writing plan. 
    * This is common in academic writing. Let's practice!
    * However, use the arrangement below as a checklist!
* Use the blank SECTIONAL template when you write 
    * TEMPLATE for ESSAY  - Sectional 8/9 paragraph
    * Careful - covers problem/solution AND criteria/analysis
    * Careful - contains an OPTIONAL 9th Description paragraph.
        * If your Intro/criteria paragraphs are too long, use it
        * If not, delete it!

# Style 
## Style for criteria
1) Try using some superlative adjectives
* "The most important thing to look for in a X is QUALITY"
* "One of the most essential qualities of a X is that it is Y"

2) use recommendation lanuage
* A good X should have Y
* A high quality X must have Y

3) Try process language
* In order to check 


## Style for analysis
### Analysis Keywords
Keywords for your Analysis paragraphs bend the normal rules. They are __actions.__ 
This means they should be "to" or "ing" verbs:
* "One way to check this is to measure Y."
* "One way to check this is measuring Y."
* "Another method for checking this criterion is to look at X
* "Another method for checking this criterion is looking at X
* "The three best ways to check this are to look at X, to measure Y, and to check X."
* "The three best ways to check this are to looking X, measuring Y, and checking X."

### Analysis sentence
Three suggestions. Different paragraphs should have different patterns to avoid boring style

### Option 1: three different pieces of evidence
1.	One major way to measure this is to X. It was found that
2.	Another way to measure this to Y. This suggested that
3.	In addition, X was also checked. This showed that
4.	As such (conclusion)

### Option 2: three DETAILS on one piece of evidence
1.	The way to measure this is to X.
2.	It was found that...
3.	This also suggested that...
4.	Additionally, it showed that...
5.	As such (conclusion)

### Option 3: a process (best if you have no outcome)
1.	One way to measure this is to X. However, nothing was found.
2.	Another way to measure this to Y. Unfortunately, nothing ...
3.	In addition, X was also checked. There was a lack of evidence...
4.	As such (no conclusion)
  
# Common Mistakes
## Not a compare contrast
This is NOT like when you [[Arrangement - write a compare-contrast]]
|criteria-analysis 										|Compare contrast
|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------
|1-3 items analysed										|2 items compares
|8 paragraph sectional essay///Intro+ 3 criterion+ 3 analysis+ conclusion |4-5 paragraphs:///Intro-thing1-thing2-conclusion///OR///Intro-topic1-topic2-topic3-conclusion
|Things being analysed not mentioned until paragraph 4 	|Thing being analysed mentioned in paragraph 1, and maybe topic of paragraph 2

## Criteria should stand alone
I should be able to take your criteria, and use them to assess three completely different choices. 
* e.g. you used the criteria price, taste, and health to analyse strawberries, bananas and apples using the criteria
* I should be able to use the SAME criteria paragraphs/slides to analyse pineapples, oranges, and grapes. Without changing them
* Remember: DO NOT mention the thing/.things you are analysingin your criteria section

## Plural is "criteria", singular "criterion"
* One criterion
* Two criteria
* Three criteria
* etc

### Use hedging
Many of you analyses will not be completely certain
Try to [[Style - use hedging]]
* "Is not effective" is usually too strong. Instead try:
* "not particularly effective"
* "does not entirely meet the criteria" 

# Description paragraph style
If you do use a description paragraph at the beginning of your analysis:
* Example section thesis statement/topic sentence: ("This section first describes one TOPIC in detail, and then critically analyses it in terms of the criteria outlined above.")
* See previous essays for how to write process/definition/partition/comparison sentences
* Link at end of description paragraph ("Now that X has been described, the following three paragraphs will analyse it in terms of the criteria described above - 1, 2, and 3.")
* Analysis paragraph topic sentence becomes "The first criterion to be considered is 1."
