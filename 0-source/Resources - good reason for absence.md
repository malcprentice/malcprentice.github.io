If you are absent or late for a good reason, tell me and I can mark you as present or on time. 
Here are some good reasons, and the proof I need. 

##1) Late Bus
Accepted for: lateness only, not absence.
Maximum: 2 times. If more, you should EXPECT it to be late. Get up earlier!
Proof needed: Screenshot if possible. Try this: https://transfer.navitime.biz/bus-navi/pc/map/Top?window=busLocation

##2) Late train
Accepted for: Lateness or absence, depending on how bad it is that day. 
Maximum: 2 times. If more, you should EXPECT it to be late. Get up earlier!

##3) Sickness
If serious (long term, visit doctor)
*Absences are excused - no specific limit, but if you miss too many classes your grade might be low and you might want to just take the course again next year. 
*I need some kind of official paperwork.
If not serious (e.g. cold)
*Absence is not excused. 
*Stay at home and use one of your normal absence days (you have 6 for twice-a-week classes).
*You will lose a participation point, but you can make that back easily (e.g. do one extra SAC visit). 

##4) Unofficial Job hunting / training
Accepted for: lateness or absence, 3rd/4th years only
Proof needed: Job hunting report - write > 100 words on what you did/ the company
Maximum: 1 time. If more, just use your normal absence days. 
*you have 6 for twice-a-week classes.
*you will lose a participation point, but you can make that back easily (e.g. do one extra SAC visit). 

##5) Official University event
Examples: Concerts, competitions, official job hunting events, representing university
Accepted for: lateness or absence 
Proof needed: Official certificate

##6)Snow day / Typhoon day
*There will be a make-up class, but since this might clash with part time work or TOEIC tests, attendance policy will be decided on a case-by-case basis.  
*School announces these by email/PLAS in term. WLC announces these by email for holiday intensives
*No announcement = no excused absence!
*However, here are some websites to help you guess what will happen if you spot snow:
