#What is Title Case?
Title case is when you give the important words in a title a capital letter (大文字)
###Example of cases
*this text is all in lower case
*THIS TEXT IS ALL IN UPPER CASE
*This Text is in Title Case

#What are the rules?
Capitalize important words:
*(大文字) = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs, and Long Words (>4 letters)
*(小文字) = and, or, not, but, a, an, the, as, at, by, for, in, of, on, to, if, do; will, do be, can have had etc.

#When do I use Title Case?
###In your homework
*The title of your essay (ABC)
*The title of your RR homework
*Subtitles in an essay with more than five paragraphs - see [[Arrangement - write a sectional essay]]

###In the references section for CONTAINERS
See [[Invention - avoid common APA format problems]] under "When do I use Title Case and Italics in the references?"
But basically: if you open a source, and it contains work by many people, use title case for the thing you open:

Type		|Title Case 			|No title case
------		|------					|------
News 		|Newspaper title 		|Newspaper article title
Book 		|Book by one author	 	|Edited book, with chapters by many authors
Journal 	|Journal title 			|Journal article title
Website		|Nothing 				|Nothing

###Even if title is _not_ in Title Case, follow the normal capital letter rules:
*Names, cities, etc still get capital letters
**e.g. Names: Harry Potter and the philosopher’s stone
**e.g. Cities: The impact of climate change on London
*First letter is still get capital letters
*First letter after a colon: Also a capital
*Acronyms (TOEIC, CIA) don't change

#Common Mistake: DON'T copy the case of the original
If your book cover  is written "MY DOG" or "My Dog" 
*It __doesn't matter!__ Ignore it!
*In your references, write "My dog" 
If your newspaper is written "JAPAN TIMES" or "japan times" or "Japan times"
*It __doesn't matter!__ Ignore it!
*In your references, write "Japan Times""
