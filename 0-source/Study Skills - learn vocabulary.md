This is how to do your vocabulary homework. 
* This homework is for every class between class 3 and 27
* Vocab test is in class 28

<red> Online 2020 - If we are still online at end of term, there will be no test, instead I will check the quality of your preparation (word cards, notebooks) </red>


# 1) Find the list
* I will share this on Google Classroom, but if you're early:
* Link is here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H_Gt5v5A9-_r3Cne4mkiYKjg_WM1hxWzEaQ-REMV0as/edit?usp=sharing
* Didn't work? 
** <red>DO NOT </red> "request access" _(アクセス権を付与)_
** Go to Gmail
** Check you're using <blue>@soka-u.jp</blue>, not @gmail.com
** Click again

# 2) Find words to study
* Read the list 
* Find words you do not know
** You probably know a lot at the top already
** But if you forgot them, learn again!
* Keep going until you have the minimum:
** SSB, ECS - 10 words per class (total 250)
** GCP - 15 words per class (total 375)
** EITC - we will discuss vocab in class 1
* Optional tip: Minimum OK, but it's faster to prepare 2-3 weeks of words at a time


# 4) Copy the words for study
* Give each word a number so I can test you later
** YOUR number (1-250, or 1-375 for GCP)
** Don't copy the number from my sheet!
* You MUST have at least:
** YOUR number, English, Japanese and POS (品詞)
** e.g. 17 - hear    - 聞く  - verb
** e.g. 18 - several - 数個の - adj
* Use either:
** A notebook
** Word cards (単語カード)
** Just use your online copy of the list
*** delete rows you don't know. 
*** add a new column with YOUR number
* Any method is OK, but 
** Your partner must be able to test you in class (can you give them your list and easily say "test me on _these_ words today please")
** We must be able to do the end of term test (can you give your list to someone and say "here are all my words for the test")

# 5) Study
* Don't just copy the words, study them! 
* Test yourself!
* Later in term, review and test old words or you will forget


# In class
* In class 3-27
** If homework is missing, you lose participation points
** you will test your partner (for practice, no points)
* In class 28 we will test you on YOUR words. 
** Randomly chosen from all your words
** 5 words Japanese-English translation
** 5 words English-Japanese translation.

# Finished the lists?
* Feel free to use other lists (e.g. TOEFL)
* Or just read more and learn useful words from there
* Or stop learning words, just [[Study Skills - guess word meanings]]
* If you are finished all the lists:
** Yell me and you are excused this homework. 
** But I will do a test on all words to check!


# Optional for later: Learn more about words (NOT HOMEWORK)
