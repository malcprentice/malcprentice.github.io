#How many words should I learn?
*Learn AT LEAST 10 words every class (280 total).
*Advanced groups: learn AT LEAST 15 every class (420 total).
*Most students say they take about 15-20 minutes.

#Which words should I learn?
Look in the shared materials folder for Vocab spreadsheet. 
*First, learn the "START HERE" tab of NGSL words useful for everyone
*Next, choose one or more of the specialised lists (careful - they overlap) 
**The "NAWL" list of university words
**The TOEIC list
**The Business list

After that you can use other lists (e.g. if you want to study TOEFL). However, word lists get quickly less useful after you have finished the lists above. 
Instead, just read more.
**If you don't know a word, just [[Study Skills - guess word meanings]]  
**If you think it might be worth learning, check: http://www.lextutor.ca/vp/comp/ - ask me in class if you are doing this and I'll show you how it works. 

All the lists below come from here:http://www.newgeneralservicelist.org


#How should I learn?
1) Download the "START HERE" excel sheet
2) Edit the sheet
*Delete the lines you already know. 
*If you already know all the "START HERE" words, use the other lists
*The other lists don't have translations - add them yourself
*RENUMBER your words (at least from 1-280)
*See the example 
4) Learn your words. Any method is OK 
*Word cards (paper/app)
*Writing each word ten times
*A Leitner box ( I will explain)
4) However, print at least the first 280 words and bring that sheet to every class
5) Be ready to tell your partner which words you have learned (e.g. "test me on words 71-80")
6) Occasionally, ask your partner to test 10 random words from your whole list.

#How will you check my homework?
*From class 3, forget your list = NG stamp
*You will test your partner on their words every class (no points).
*As soon as you have enough words (about week 3), I will start making online tests
*You will take one online test after every class
*There will be an end of term test. 

#Remember - one word = many words.
Use any of these words in your list, examples and sentences.
