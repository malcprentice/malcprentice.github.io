# 1) Find the recommended word list
* Click this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H_Gt5v5A9-_r3Cne4mkiYKjg_WM1hxWzEaQ-REMV0as/edit?usp=sharing
* __If__ you get the "request access" (権限が必要です) message:
** __do not__ request access
** go back to Gmail
** check you are using @soka-u.jp
** try again

# 2) Choose words to learn
* Read down the list
* Ignore words you already know.  
* __Choose words you don't know.__  
* Keep going until you have enough words

__How many words?__
* SSB, ECS, EITC
** __10 words__ per class 
** (total 250)
* GCP 
** __15 words__ per class 
** (total 375)

# 3) Copy the words you choose into your notebook
* Copy three things: English+Japanese+品詞
* Number your words 1,2,3,4,etc

__It should look like this:__
Number  |English  |Japanese  |POS (品詞)
---     |-------- |--------- |---------
1       |hear     |聞く       |verb
2       |several  |数個の     |adj
3       |word     |単語       |noun
4       |card     |カード     |noun
etc.    |          |         | 

<green>IMPORTANT:</green> "Number" means __YOUR__ number, not Malc's list number


# 4) Study!
* Don't just copy, study! 
* Any method is OK. __Your choice.__ For example:
** Just study your notebook - cover and check 
** Use Word cards (単語カード)
** Write sentences 
** Copy each word 10 times
** Use Memrise: https://www.memrise.com/
** Use  Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/

__Any method is OK, but <green> also keep your notebook</green>__ 
* Your partner needs a list to test you in class 
* We need a list in class 28 to make your vocab test 

# HOMEWORK - What will be checked?
## First vocab homework (for class 3)
* Finish your first list
* Take a photo of your notebook page
* EMAIL it to Malc
* Remember to [[Study Skills - write a well formatted email]]
** Use "Example email 1: Here is my homework"
** Homework code is V1
** e.g. subject "Hiroko Sato - SSB/ECS/EITC/GCP - V1"

## Every class (for class 3, 4, 5, 6..., & 27)
* If we are online 
** Don't email a photo every week
** Malc will ask to check your notebook occasionally 
** Just keep studying. 

* If we are on campus
** You will test your partner 
** If you forget your homework, -1 participation point

## At the end of term (class 28)
### Online 
If we are online, I will tell you about the test later

### On campus
* One test (10%) on YOUR words. 
** Randomly chosen from all your words
** 5 words Japanese-English translation
** 5 words English-Japanese translation
** One spelling mistake OK (not two)
** Must be correct POS (品詞)
** Translations with same meaning OK


# Advanced class options
## Finished the lists? 
* Use other lists (e.g. TOEFL)
* Read more and choose words
* If learning vocab is not useful any more:
** Just read and [[Study Skills - guess word meanings]]
** Tell me and you are excused this homework. 
** But I will do a test on all list words to check!
