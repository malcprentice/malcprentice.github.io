# Aim
By the end of this unit, you will know:
* How to find Malc's suggested word lists
* How to prepare your homework
* How you will be tested in class
* How you will be graded at the end of term

__Homework is listed below, but a quick summary:__
* This homework is for every class between class 3 and 27
** SSB, ECS, EITC - __10 words__ per class (total 250)
** GCP - __15 words__ per class (total 375)
* Vocab test is in class 28

<red> Online 2020 </red> - If we are still online at end of term, the test format will change 

# 1) Find the recommended word list
* I will share a word list on Google Classroom
* Find "Vocabulary" and open the link (Google Sheets).
* Can't see it? Check 'Classwork', or read this:
** Instructions in English: https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6020284?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en
** Instructions in Japanese: https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/6020284?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=ja
* You can make a copy of this and edit it

# 2) Choose words to learn
* Read the list  
* Start at the top, scroll down
** Ignore words you already know.  
** __Choose words you don't know.__  
* Keep looking until you have enough words:
** SSB, ECS, EITC - __10 words__ per class (total 250)
** GCP - __15 words__ per class (total 375)
** __Tip:__ It's faster to choose more words (e.g. 60) at a time (so you can just study for a few weeks without opening the list every time)

# 3) Start making your own personal study list
__Two easy choices:__
* a) Copy them into a notebook
* b) Just edit my list ("File" -> "Make a copy")
** Delete the rows with words you know
** Keep the rows with words you don't know

__NUMBER__ the words you copy
* This makes testing easier later
* Number them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5....250 for SSB/ECS/EITC
* Number them 1, 2, 3, 4, 5....375 for GCP
* Don't use numbers from my sheet! Use YOUR number

__You only need these four things:__
Number  |English  |Japanese  |POS (品詞)
---     |-------- |--------- |---------
1       |hear     |聞く       |verb
2       |several  |数個の     |adj
3       |word     |単語       |noun
etc.     |          |         | 



# 4) Study!
* Don't just copy the words, study them! 
* Test yourself, and test old words or you will forget!
* Any way you prefer is OK. For example:
** Just study from your online sheet - cover and check 
** Copy them onto Word cards (単語カード)
** Write sentences with the words
** Copy each word 10 times
** Copy them into Memrise: https://www.memrise.com/
** Copy them into Quizlet: https://quizlet.com/

__But any method you use, <green>keep your words in a list too!</green>__ 
* Your partner will need a list to test you on today's words
* We will need a list to make your final vocab test in class 28


# HOMEWORK - What will be checked?
## First vocab homework (for class 3)
Vocab 1 (just to make sure you are OK)
* If we are in class, show Malc your list
* <red> Online 2020? </red> Please EMAIL your first vocab homework to Malc to check. CHOOSE from these:
** Did you copy into a notebook? Submit a photo of page 1
** Did you edit Malc's list instead? Submit the file or a screenshot.

## Every class (for class 3, 4, 5, 6..., & 27)
* If we are in a classroom
** If you forget today's words, you lose participation points
** You will test your partner (for practice, no points)
* <red>If we are online</red>
** Malc will occasionally ask to see your word list so far

## At the end of term (class 28)
<red> Online - This test format will change </red>
* We will test you on YOUR words. 
** Randomly chosen from all your words
** 5 words Japanese-English translation
** 5 words English-Japanese translation
** One spelling mistake OK (not two)
** Must be correct POS (品詞)
** Translations with same meaning OK


# Advanced options
## Finished the lists? 
* Feel free to use other lists (e.g. TOEFL)
* Or just read more and learn useful words from there
* Or stop learning words, just [[Study Skills - guess word meanings]]
* If you are finished learning vocab:
** Tell me and you are excused this homework. 
** But I will do a test on all list words to check!
