This sheet is about how to USE a poster. For more on how to MAKE the poster, see [[Study Skills - make a poster]]

# At a real conference. 
At conference, you either:
* stand beside your poster then take it down
* stand beside your poster for 30 mins, but leave it up

Either way:
1) Stand near your poster, but not so near no-one wants to get close. 
2) Don't immediately start talking - wait for them to read a bit and ask a question
3) If they walk away, let them (but maybe offer a handout if you have one)
4) You will need pins, magnets or tape (you often don't know the situation, so bring all)
5) They will probably not read the poster carefully (with you standing there, you have about 45 second before silence becomes uncomfortable and they ask something to be polite or smile and move on)
6) Most common questions:
* "What is X / What does X mean"
* A request for a Final Comment (e,g, "So overall, what should I do if")
* A question about your research methods/materials (if it's about research)
* Not a question - a comment from their experience/knowledge of the topic
* "Can you tell me more about this part"
* Sometimes people don't want to read, so they'll just ask something like "So, what's this one about" and expect a short summary

Remember - you're not presenting, you're answering questions (except if someone asks for a summary, in which case it's more like a mini informal presentation)

# Assessment in class
* You are (usually) not assessed on your slides
** Your slides should be perfect - we've checked them several times. 
** However, you will get a minus point for any mistake I pointed out that you didn't fix on the slides.
* In class, I'll use "Can you tell me more about KEYWORD"
* You start with 6 points, as usual
* You are assessed on the INVENTION of you answer (+1,0,-1)
** You need to be able to say something for each keyword.
** You need to tell me something that is not on the slide
** YOu need to be understandable 
* You are assessed on DELIVERY of your answer
** Delivery = control of eye contact, body language, and voice (+1, 0, -1 each)
** Talk to the whole audience, not just the person who asked the question. 
** Talk to humans, not your poster!
** Control of notes is part of body language. 
*** Cue cards are best
*** Any other notes also OK, but don't hold a full size laptop


Difficult part is remembering to continue eye contact, gestures, etc when answering questions.
You need to practice at home!
