This is for projects where you plan a trip. 
Also, some people have asked how I do this. 
These are real suggestions - this is how I usually plan a trip. 
Think about these options when you are deciding whether to do a DIY study abroad or a package. 


# Transport
## Finding Flights
I use the tools below to find a flight, not sure which is best
*Expedia: https://www.expedia.co.jp/ 
*Kayak: https://www.kayak.co.jp/
*Skyscanner: https://www.skyscanner.com
*Google Flights: https://www.google.co.jp/flights/# flt=/m/07s8_ct..2019-05-22*./m/07s8_ct.2019-05-26;c:JPY;e:1;ls:1w;sd:0;t:h
*Some European budget airlines ("LCC") DON'T always appear in search, check them separately 
**Easyjet (Europe): https://www.easyjet.com 
**Ryanair (Europe): https://www.ryanair.com
*Asian LCCs like Scoot and AIr Asia usually appear in search, but if they don't maybe check. 

## Actually booking flights
After FINDING the flight, I often end up BUYING tickets from the airline website directly - it's easier to decide to tweak times, book seats, etc. 


## Trains
I like trains - 
*they go from city centre to city centre with 
*Less hassle with check in
*Night trains save on accomodation
*Sometimes, though, they're just too slow. Check Seat61: http://www.seat61.com/
*Usually you book through individual country websites. 

## Buses
*Usually not a good idea. Sometimes the only option.
*Try Flixbus ( https://www.flixbus.com/ ) but expect long long delays.  

# Accomodation 
## Finding Hotels
*Expedia: https://www.expedia.co.jp/
*TripAdvisor reviews: https://www.tripadvisor.com/

## Actually booking hotels
*hotels.com (simple loyalty system): http://hotels.com

## Shares
*AirBNB ( http://www.airbnb.com/c/mprentice39 ) are:
**Cheap if you share, almost as much as hotels if you don't
**A good deal if you want a kitchen and a washing machine. 
*Housesitting: https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/house-sitting/
**Haven't tried it yet, but if you have 2 weeks and like cats...


## Hostels
Try hostels.com: http://hostels.com 
Some search engines also show hostels. In fact it is often no clear what you are booking. 
Be careful - they're not necessarily cheap. Private rooms sometimes cost almost the same as a hotel for popular city in summer
Same as AirBNB - depends on place and time. 
I've stayed in some great places in countryside Scotland
Dorms are not for everyone. However, when I was younger, they were a good place to meet people. 

# Things to do
*Tripadvisor for top 10s in each area: https://www.tripadvisor.com/
*Atlas Obscura, for unusual places: http://www.atlasobscura.com
*Just google "top ten things to do in..."


# Things not to do
Research possible risks - FCO: https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice

# Insurance
*World Nomads: https://www.worldnomads.com/ (unlike some, they cover adventure sports and volunteer work)


# Maps
Offline maps for when there is no wifi: 
*Google maps (some countries it doesn't work). Download BEFORE you go - they use a lot of data
*If you can't download Google maps, or as a backup, try maps.me: https://maps.me
