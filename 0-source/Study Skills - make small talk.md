A conversation has 6 parts: A, B, C, D, E, & F
Do __all 6__ every time you change partners

# A) Say Hello
Hi/Hey/Morning/Afternoon/Evening

|How's it going? /// How are things? /// How’ve you been? |Good. You?
|What’s new? /// What's up? 					|Not much. You?
|Alright? 									|Alright. You?

# B) Make small talk
### For people you just met:
|What’s your name?	|Where are you from? 	                    |Where do you live
|What's your major?  |What other classes are you taking?			|What circles are you in?


### For people you see every week.
|Past 	|How was the weekend? 		|Get up to anything last night? |How was the holiday?
|Plans 	|Any plans tonight? 		|Are you doing anything this weekend? |Any plans for the holiday?
|School 	|How are classes going? 	|Have you chosen your seminar?
|Work	|How's work going? 			|How's job hunting going?
|Weather |Hot, isn't it?

### For when those questions get boring
See [[Study Skills - ask good questions]]

### Short follow-up questions
What kind? 	How much? How many? How often?
How was it? Then what? What else?
Where? Who with? When? Why?

# C) Change the topic
* So…
* Anyway…
* Hey, by the way, ...
* Oh! Did you ...
* Oh! Did you hear about (+ news)


# D) Fill your silence
While you are speaking, use words like this to fill silences
|Any time        |Beginning      |Middle     |End
|----------------|----------------|----------|
|Ummmmm			|It’s like...   |sorta      |, right?
|Uh              |Well...        |kinda      |, ok?
|Er  	        |See...         |like       |, yknow?
|	            |I mean, ...    |maybe        |, yeah?

You can also just stretch sounds ("I think you shouuuuuuuuld read more")

* Example:
    * I went to the park
    * "Well, I like uhh just sorta went ummm to theeeEEE park, yknow?"

* "Middle" = before (sometimes after) a verb or adjective
* This is not good in a formal situation (e.g. presentation, meeting).
* Even in conversation, too much is strange. But it's
* better than going completely silent.


# E) Backchannel
### While you are listening, use backchannels (相槌)
|Anytime///I'm listening |I'm happy for you  |I agree    |I'm surprised  |Other meanings
|------------------------|-------------------|-----------|-------------- |-----------
|Mm-Hmm                  |Good               |Exactly    |Woah!           |Ugh
|Uh-huh                  |Great              |Definitely |What!           |Oh no!
|yeah/yep                |Excellent          |True       |You’re kidding! |Oops!
|OK                      |Cool               |Right      |Nah!            |Huh?
|I see                   |Wow                |Sure       |Really?!        |
|Got it.                 |                   |           |

* Use column  1 more when on the phone.
* BE CAREFUL with tone of voice
* YOu can also just repeat

# F) Finish
Finishing a conversation has four parts:

|1) Start to say goodbye	|2) Give a reason		|3) Promise to contact	|4) Actual goodbye
|------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------
|Oh, look at the time	|My bus is coming.		|See you next week 		|Cheerio (UK)
