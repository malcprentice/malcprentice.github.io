	<p>	Sometimes you need to soften what you say. Usually: </p>
<ul><li>	 When you are not sure something is true </li>
<li>	 When it is true, but you are not sure it is 100% important/successful. </li>

</ul>	<p>	Imagine you need to <a href="Arrangement - write a summary-response.html">write a summary-response</a> </p>
<ul><li>	 Your problem is waribashi.  </li>
<li>	 You summarize a solution (carry your own chopsticks) </li>
<li>	 Now you need to respond. Does your solution actually solve the problem? </li>
<li>	 The answer is probably not "yes" or "no".  </li>
<li>	 The answer is probably "partly" or "maybe".  </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Qualify uncertain facts ("Despite the lack of evidence, it seems likely that") </p>
	<p>	Qualify weak citations ("Based on Smith (1999), it seems that X, however" </p>
	<p>	Qualify when no evidence is available </p>

	<p>	Weasel words means qualifying evidence to hide the fact it is missing.   </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	
<table border="1">  <tr><th>Question				</th><th> Honest answer 					</th><th>Weasel words</th></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Who said that?			</td><td>I don't know 						</td><td>Some people say</td></tr> </p>

	<p>	Always yourself these questions about your research and results. It is better to say no evidence was found than hide the fact you didn't find any. Here are some more questions to ask when you read these phrases in your research: </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	
<table border="1">  <tr><th>If you read... 						</th><th>Ask...</th></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>"A growing body of evidence" 		</td><td>By who?</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>"It has been claimed that..." 		</td><td>By who?</td></tr> </p>

	<p>	<tr><td>"There is evidence that..."  		</td><td>What evidence?</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>"There is strong evidence that..." 	</td><td>Can you explain WHY it is strong</td></tr> </p>
</table><br>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Avoid qualifying numbers">	 Avoid qualifying numbers </h3>
	<p>	If you know the exact number, give it.  </p>
	<p>	If you do not know it, find out. </p>
	<p>	
<table border="1">  <tr><th>If you read... 				</th><th>Ask...</th></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>"Over 75%"					</td><td>How far over? 76? 99?</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>"Very few"					</td><td>How few? 1? 2? 77?</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>"The vast majority..." 		</td><td>Is this 77% or 99%?</td></tr> </p>
</table><br>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	"A majority" means "I don't know how much, because it is impossible to tell, but based on my research so far, most say X" <strong> NOT </strong> "I don't know how much, because I don't have time to research"  </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Avoid vagueness words">	 Avoid vagueness words </h3>
	<p>	Basically, ... Essentially, ....  </p>
	<p>	(OK for summaries, but too vague for qualifications) </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Avoid slang">	 Avoid slang </h3>
	<p>	<strike>"Kind of big", "Pretty big", "Really big" and "Sort of big " </strike> </p>
	<p>	These are too informal for academic essays  </p>
	<p>	"Rather" is quite an old word, when used for qualifier.   </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Avoid repetition">	 Avoid repetition </h3>
	<p>	Don't repeat qualifiers (" a lot...a lot... alot... very...very...very") </p>
	<p>	Look at the list above - try some new ones.  </p>
	<p>	If you need to know how to use them in a sentence, look them up:  <a href="http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/"> (link) </a> </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Avoid qualifying too often">	 Avoid qualifying too often </h3>
	<p>	Try not to use too many qualifiers </p>
	<p>	If you are using a lot, it is a sign you need to do more research </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Don't qualify your conclusion or final comment">	 Don't qualify your conclusion or final comment </h3>
	<p>	You spent an essay building up to this sentence. You've spent weeks researching it. Why are you still unsure? Be specific about why. Don't just qualify for no reason.  </p>
