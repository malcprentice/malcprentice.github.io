# Style - Using Keywords, the main rules. 

## These rules are mostly for: 
* Thesis statement "essay contents" lists
* Topic sentence "paragraph contents" lists
* The above, but repeated in summaries


## The rules
* To use them easily, keywords should be 
    * Nouns (名詞）
        * Single nouns "Secondly, pollution"
        * Noun phrases "Secondly, lack of pollution"
    * ING verbs (動名詞)  "Secondly, reducing pollution"
    * Question word phrases "Secondly, how to increase participation"
* DO NOT use:
    * Adjectives ~~"Second, happy."~~
    * Adverbes ~~"Second, happily."~~
* DO NOT MIX! All nouns, all verbs, try not to mix. 
    * OK: preparation, cooking, and decoration.
    * OK: preparing, cooking, and decorating.
    * OK: prepare, cook and decorate.
    * OK: how to prepare, how to cook, and how to decorate
    * ~~NO: how to prepare, cooking, and decoration~~
* DO NOT WRITE FULL SENTENCES
    * OK: "pollution, child labour, and conflict"
    * OK: "harmful air pollution, widespread child labour, and conflict between religious groups"
    * TOO LONG: ~~"the difficulty of experiencing harmful air pollution daily, widespread use of child labour that harms young people every day, and conflict between various groups who are competing for political control"~~
* DO NOT FORGET THE COMMA
    * 1, 2, and 3.
    * ~~1, 2 and 3.~~
