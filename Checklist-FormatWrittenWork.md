# Delivery: Format Written Work


## The easy way - just don't break the template
* Does your written work still look like the template?
* If not, it's probably because you copy=pasted from the internet
    * Stop copy-pasting! Take your own notes, then write from notes
    * If you have to copy paste, paste without format
        * Windows: CTRL-SHIFT-V 
        * Mac: Command-Shift-V
        * If that doesn't work, try the edit menu. 

## The hard way - check everything
* Is everything 12pt 
* Is everything Times New Roman
* No bold
* No underline. 
* Italics 
    * In text - for emphasis or non-English words. 
    * In references - see [Invention - General Rules](Invention-ReferenceGeneralRules)
* Alignment
    * Title centre aligned (中央揃え)
    * References left aligned
    * Text - depends on teacher
        * University style is justified
        * APA and I prefer left 
* Title rules
    * Title in Title Case. 
    * See [Style - Use Title Case](Style-UseTitleCase)
    * Basically: Short words <4 letters usually no capital
        * and, or, not, but,

        * as, at, by, for, in, of, on, to, out
