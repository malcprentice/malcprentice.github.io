	<p>	The following is an example from Longman - the Homeschooling listening is on page 334 in the new (white) edition, but the below was based on the purple book (not sure if it's different). </p>
	<p>	1) Do the listening and reading yourself first </p>
	<p>	2) Check your notes against mine (below) </p>
	<p>	3) Use the templates above to do your own version.  </p>

	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Reading Notes  </h4>
<ol>
	<li>	 BACKGROUND: Homeschooling becoming more popular.  </li>
	<li>	 DEFINITION: Homeschooling is: 
		<ol>
		<li>	 keep children out of traditional classes </li>
		<li>	 (traditional = 1 teacher-20/30 children) </li>
		<li>	 parents educate kids at home </li>

</ol>
</li>	
<li>	 TS: Homeschooling not good 
		<ol>
		<li>	 Reason 1-  not learn as much 
			<ol>
			<li>	 trad. schools - must learn huge amount of material </li>
			<li>	 home = no requirement to master X before moving to new level </li>

</ol>
</li>		
<li>	 Reason 2 - Less social interaction 
			<ol>
			<li>	 parents and a few brothers/sisters only </li>

</ol>
</li>		
<li>	 Reason 3 - Less broad curriculum. Trad. sch have: 
			<ol>
			<li>	 more established curriculum </li>
			<li>	 more variety of subjects </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Listening Notes  </h4>
<ol>
	<li>	 TS: not true - part of panel - disagree </li>
	<li>	 IDEA 1 not proven that learn less 
		<ol>
		<li>	 many studies proved learn far more </li>

</ol>
</li>	
<li>	 IDEA 2 lots of interaction -  
		<ol>
		<li>	 parents arrange it with other homeschooled children </li>
		<li>	 could be MORE interaction, as can happen any time </li>

</ol>
</li>	
<li>	 IDEA 3 Variety of curriculum MORE  
		<ol>
		<li>	 because not limited by school boards, can teach anything </li>
		<li>	 e.g. astronomy, medicine, Chinese </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
