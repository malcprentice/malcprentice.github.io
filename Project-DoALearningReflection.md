# Project - Do A Learning Reflection

Reflect     ("ÂèçÊò†„Åô„Çã") on your learning, and try to improve it!


## A) Think about your learning

What issues are you having? In class or outside. For example:

* "I keep submitting homework late"
* "My TOEIC listening is weak"
* "I got a bad score and I don't know why"
* "My TOEFL writing level is much lower than my speaking"
* "I can't wake up in the morning and I always feel tired"
* "I don't know what my plan is for the future or why I'm doing this"

## B) Make a plan to fix the problem. 

You might need help with this. You could try:

* Your own ideas 
* Talk to an older student you know
* Talk to a classmate who is good at the thing you think is hard
* Ask Malc 
* Think about using one of the university's other support centres 
* Try the [Study Skills Review](https://alba-english.org/Project-StudySkillsReview.html)

## C) Try your idea!  Reflect again

* Did it work or not? 
* What happened? 

## D) Are you finished working on this issue? 

* Yes? What will you work on next?
* No? OK, what's your next idea for solving the issue?

## E) Report: 

### In complete __detailed__ sentences in __past tense,__  tell me:
* A - What was the problem
* BC - What did you do to fix the problem?
* D - Did it work? Why/Why not? 
* E - What will you do next?
