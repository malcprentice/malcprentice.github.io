# Project - Do A Learning Reflection

Reflect("反映する") on your learning, and try to improve it!


## A) Think about your learning

What issues do you have? In class or outside. For example:

* "I keep submitting homework late"
* "I got a bad score and I don't know why"
* "I can't wake up in the morning and I always feel tired"
* "I don't know what my plan is for the future or why I'm doing this"

## B) Make a plan to fix the problem. 

You might need help with this. You could try:

* Your own ideas 
* Talk to an older student you know
* Talk to a classmate who is good at the thing you think is hard
* Ask Malc in class for ideas
* Ask Malc in office hours (Extra point if you do! See above!)
* Go to the WLC SAC "English Consultation Room" for advice on learning
* Think about using one of the university's other support centres (e.g. Oasis)
* Try the [Study Skills Review](https://alba-english.org/Project-StudySkillsReview.html)

## C) Try your idea!  Reflect again

* Did it work or not? 
* What happened? 

## D) Are you finished working on this issue? 

* Yes? What will you work on next?
* No? OK, what's your next idea for solving the issue?

## E) Report: 

### In complete __detailed__ sentences in __past tense,__  tell me:
* 1 - What was the problem
* 2/3 - What did you do to fix the problem?
* 4 - Did it work? Why/Why not?
