## Common Mistakes
* Double check the formatting
    * Times New Roman
    * 12 pt
    * Double spaced
    * Burasage
* The reference list matches the references used. 
    * Nothing in text that isn't in list. 
    * Nothing in list that isn't in the text 
    * 5 names in text = 5  matching names in references
* Double check you match the examples on:
    * Title Case
    * spaces, commas, and periods. 
* No double dates. If you have a date, don't use "Retrieved"
    * Not correct - no date or double date
        * ... (n.d.). Title of Source. http://etc
        * ... (2017). Title of Source. Retrieved April 27, 2022, from http://etc
    * Correct - one date only
        * ... (2017). Title of Website Source. http://etc
        * ... (n.d.). Title of Website Source. Retrieved April 27, 2022, from ...

    * OK: Suzuki, H. (2020)
    * NO: ~~Hiroki, S.~~ (2020)
    * NO: ~~Suzuki, Hiroki~~ (2020)
* Ignore the case of the original!
    * If the title is written "MY DOG"
        * It doesn't matter! Ignore it!
        * Write "My dog" (book, article title) or My Dog (magazine name)
    * If your newspaper is written  "japantimes"
        * It doesn't matter! Ignore it!
        * In your references, write "Japan Times"

## A closer look at Italics 

*Italics can be confusing. Follow the examples, but if you are wondering why something in APA is italics, here is the rule:*

***Italics in APA = the thing you hold in your hand***

### The confusing bit is online vs paper
* For books, journals
    * It doesn't matter if they're online or not
    * Most of the good ones are both. 
* For news sources, it changes
    * If newspaper sells a paper copy
        * You could buy and hold the whole issue
        * YOu don't rip out and hold the article
        * No italics for article title. 
        * Italics for *Newspaper Name*
            * *Mainichi Shimbun*
            * *Japan Times*
    * Newspaper if it is online ONLY
        * You can't buy and hold the whole issue
        * You might print and hold one article
        * Italics for *article title.*
        * No italics for newspaper name
            * BBC News
            * Reuters / AP / AFPBBNews

### In summary: 
|Type        | *You hold this = italics*                               | You do not hold = no italics
|---         |---                                                      |---
|Book        |*Title of the book* you hold                             |the chapter title you don't rip out
|Magazine    |*Title of the magazine* you hold                         |the article title you don't rip out
|newspaper   |*Title of the newspaper* you hold                        |the article title you don't rip out
|news website |*Title of the article title* you *could* print and hold |the news group - you couldn't print the whole site
|normal website |*The title of the page* you *could* print and hold    |the site name - you couldn't print the whole site
|Journal article |*The journal NAME and bound VOLUME number*           |The issue, article, or page number

## A Closer Look at Title Case

Title Case can be Confusing. Follow the Examples, but if you are Wondering why in APA is Title Case, Here is the Rule:

**Title Case in APA = the Name of a Collection**

|Type        |Collection - Title Case                    |Not a collection = no title case
|---         |---                                        |---
|News        |*Newspaper Title*                          |article title
|Journal     |*Journal Title*                            |article title
|Video       |TED Talks                                  |*video title*
|Websites    |Website Name                               |*website page title*
|Normal book |Nothing - not a collection                 |*The book title.* 
|Book with chapters by different people  |*Book Name*    |Chapter in book

* PAPER collections are *also italics*  
* ONLINE collections are not italics
