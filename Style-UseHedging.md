# Style - Use Hedging



Sometimes you need to soften what you say. Usually:

* When you are not sure something is true
* When it is true, but you are not sure it is 100% important/successful.
* Imagine your problem paragraph is about waribashi. 
    * You summarize a solution (carry your own chopsticks)
    * Now you need to respond. Does your solution actually solve the problem?
    * The answer is probably not "yes" or "no". 
    * The answer is probably "partly" or "maybe". 
* You can
    * Qualify uncertain facts ("Despite the lack of evidence, it seems likely that")
    * Qualify weak citations ("Based on Smith (1999), it seems that X, however"
    * Qualify when no evidence is available

## How NOT to qualify

### Avoid Weasel Words 
Weasel words means qualifying evidence to hide the fact it is missing.  

Question				| Honest answer 					|Weasel words
------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------
Who said that?			|I don't know 						|Some people say
What is the evidence?	|There isn't any, or I didn't look 	|A growing body of evidence says that
"Is the evidence strong? |I'm not sure 						|It is obvious that
Does anyone disagree 	|I didn't look 						|Critics claim that

Always yourself these questions about your research and results. It is better to say no evidence was found than hide the fact you didn't find any. Here are some more questions to ask when you read these phrases in your research:

If you read... 						|Ask...
------------------------------------|------------------
"A growing body of evidence" 		|By who?
"It has been claimed that..." 		|By who?
"It has been noted that..." 		|By who?
"Many people" 						|How many people? Who are they?
"Critics claim..."  				|Who claims?
"Clearly/Obviously/Evidently" 		|It's not clear or obvious or evident. ///Can you explain why you think it is?
"There is evidence that..."  		|What evidence?
"There is strong evidence that..." 	|Can you explain WHY it is strong

### Avoid qualifying numbers
If you know the exact number, give it. 
If you do not know it, find out.

If you read... 				|Ask...
----------------------------|------------------
"Over 75%"					|How far over? 76? 99?
"Very few"					|How few? 1? 2? 77?
"The vast majority..." 		|Is this 77% or 99%?

* "A majority"  
    * DO USE FOR "I don't know how much, because it is impossible to tell, but based on my research so far, most say X" 
    * DO NOT USE FOR "I don't know how much, because I don't have time to research" 

### Avoid vagueness words
Basically, ... Essentially, .... 
(OK for summaries, but too vague for qualifications)

### Avoid slang
~~"Kind of big", "Pretty big", "Really big" and "Sort of big "~~
These are too informal for academic essays 
"Rather" is quite an old word, when used for qualifier.  

### Avoid repetition
Don't repeat qualifiers (" a lot...a lot... alot... very...very...very")
Look at the list above - try some new ones. 
If you need to know how to use them in a sentence, look them up: http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/

### Avoid qualifying too often
Try not to use too many qualifiers
If you are using a lot, it is a sign you need to do more research

### Avoid using on your conclusion or final comment
You spent an essay building up to this sentence. You've spent weeks researching it. Why are you still unsure?
