## "Active Listening"(相槌)
* Just Listening (from the DSC book)
    * I see 
    * Uh-huh  
    * OK  
    * Right
    * Sure 
    * Really   
    * Mmhmm
* Other meanings 
    * Great!
    * What??
    * Wow!!
    * That's amazing!!
    * You're kidding?!             
    * Oh no!
    * Ugh!
    * Oops!
    * Huh?
* You can also just repeat
    * A: I went to the park
    * B: The park? 
    * A: Yes, and....
         
Show you are listening! Careful with tone. Happy voice! Tone changes meaning, and low-boring voice meaning is sarcasm (皮肉)

## Listener - stop them if you don't understand
* Excuse me.
* Sorry
* Can I just stop you there a second.

## Listener - "Once more please?"
* Could you repeat that please?
* Could you say that again?
* Can you explain X?
* What does "WORD" mean?

## Listener - Repeat to check ("Paraphrase")
* Do you mean…
* So, in other words,  
* So are you saying (that)  
* OK, so so you mean (that)

## Listener - if that doesn't work, then:  
* Sorry. I don’t understand
* Sorry, I don't follow
* Sorry, I didn't catch that
* SOrry, I didn't quite get that. 

 
## Speaker - Check understanding 
* Do you understand?
* Do you follow?
* Do you see what I mean?
## Speaker - Repeat yourself ("Paraphrase")
* I mean..
* What I mean is...
* What I'm saying is
* In other words
