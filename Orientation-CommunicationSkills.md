## "Active Listening"(相槌)
* Just Listening (from the DSC book)
    * I see 
    * Uh-huh  
    * OK  
    * Right
    * Sure 
    * Really   
    * Mmhmm
* Other meanings 
    * Great!
    * What??
    * Wow!!
    * That's amazing!!
    * You're kidding?!             
    * Oh no!
    * Ugh!
    * Oops!
    * Huh?
* You can also just repeat
    * A: I went to the park
    * B: The park? 
    * A: Yes, and....
         
Show you are listening! Careful with tone. Happy voice! Tone changes meaning, and low-boring voice meaning is sarcasm (皮肉)

* Do you follow?
* Do you see what I mean?
