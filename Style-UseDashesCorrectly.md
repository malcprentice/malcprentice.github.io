# Style - Use Dashes Correctly 


## Ignore this worksheet! You probably don't need it!
* Most people don't know the real rules. They just use hyphen (minus key) for everything. 
* However, sometimes Microsoft Word will fix something for you and get it wrong. If you're interested in which one is correct, here are the rules. 

## Look at the length
* \- \- \-      (hyphen) 
* – – –         (n-dash)
* — — —         (m-dash) 
* ー ー ー       (Japanese、doubleーbyte hyphen


## Here are the rules 
* Hyphens join PARTS of things, usually a number or adjective
    * in-depth
    * check-in
    * left-handed
    * family-owned business
    * pre-Christmas
    * self-motivated
    * twenty-one
    * 080-111-1111
* N-dashes show range "to"
    * Monday–Friday
    * July–August
    * 18–35 years old
    * 1975–1976
    * Japan vs. Argentina  5–1
    * Tokyo–Osaka Shinkansen
* M-dashes are hardly ever used
    * But for reference
        * they are [like brackets](Style-UseParentheticals)
        * "This sounds wrong—it is wrong—but I feel penguins would make better pets than cats."
    * In reality, 
        * They're only used in very carefully edited writing. 
        * In the UK, even editors usually prefer n-dashes (There are three problems – 1, 2, and 3 – of which...).
        * Most people just hit the hyphen key. Word or Docs changes automatically to an n-dash. You only need to care if one of the pair doesn't get fixed ("There are three problems – 1, 2, and 3 \- of which...")
* Japanese double-byte hyphen
    * Never correct in English text. Breaks spacing. 
    * Also avoid double byte commas、spaces and （　brackets
