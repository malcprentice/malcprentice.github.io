# Project - Research Presentation
The aim this project is to practice reading (news articles), listening (lectures), note taking, summary writing, presentation skills, [asking good questions](Style-AskGoodQuestions), making slideshows, leading discussions, discussion participation, learning reflection, and APA referencing.  

## Step 1: Listen to a lecture
* Visit the TED website https://www.ted.com/talks
* Select "6-12 mins"
* Look for an interesting topic and title
* Listen to 20 seconds, English only. 
    * Hard accent? Super fast speaker? 
    * Maybe choose another
* Need help?  
    * Try English subtitles or transcript
    * Still need help? Check the Japanese transcript. 
    * However, if you use these, watch in English one time after
* Take notes
    * I will review options in class (mind map, bullets, cornell)
    * Notes in Japanese OK. Notes are for you only, presentation is for class. 

## Step 2: Find a related news article
* Google the topic covered in the talk.
* ENGLISH ONLY. Japanese sources OK in essays, not here. 
* Find a NEWS article about the topic
    * Less than one year old
    * A newspaper or news magazine is best
    * NGO news OK if it's a large reliable group (check wikipedia)
    * Try [Google's News tab](https://www.google.com/search?q=penguins&source=lnms&tbm=nws)
* It doesn't have to be an exact match. For example if talk is "problem caused for penguins in Galapagos by global warming", your reading could be about:
    * a) The Galapagos 
    * b) OR penguins 
    * c) OR global warming
* Take notes

## Step 3: Check your notes
* How long is your presentation? Do you have enough notes? 
* You need about 9 ideas 
    * 3 steps, times, reasons, problems, solutions
    * 3 detail keywords on each step
* If you are short, read another article!
* Remember to keep the URL (http addresses) of the talk and article


## Step 4: Get your Presentation ready (9 slides minimum)
* I will share "Template for RR"
* Follow the template carefully. 
* I will review in class, but common mistakes are: 
    * Titles: keywords, in title case, consistent format
    * Every body slide needs EITHER
        * Image and text
        * Image and no text - if image has meaning (map, chart, graph, etc)
    * Try to use [free images search](https://www.google.com/search?q=penguin&tbm=isch&tbs=il:cl&hl=en)
    * Formatting has MEANING in presentations
        * e.g. bottom right 14pt gray Arial = "this is a citation"
        * Check size, colour, font, position is consistent
    * No more than 3s to read a slide
    * If you are going to SAY it don't WRITE it
    * No sentences! Keywords only 
    * Bullets are LISTS - use â‰¥2 or delete
* Spellcheck and proof read!
* No penguins!    
* Script is optional
* Question slide follow rule- [ask good questions](Style-AskGoodQuestions)
* References slide 
    * in alphabetical order. 
    * TWO citations - TED+News. Maybe three if your news article was short

## Step 5: Prepare to Present
* Homework: Decide on script, notes, or nothing. I'll review the options in class. 
* Homework: Practice 3-4 times for fluency
* Common mistakes include
    * No floppy A4 notes
    * No tiny scripts on your phone. 
    * Start your presentation, don't just show your file
    * During discussion, Keep speaking to everyone. You are STILL PRESENTING

## Step 6: Present
* Present (I'll give tips in class)
* [Feedback](Style-GiveGoodFeedback)
* Lead discussion

# Assessment
* Body Language 
    * Control you hands - don't fiddle with your notes, clothes, hair 
    * Don't wave your notes. 
    * Don't shuffle your feet
* Eye contact
    * Speak at the audience 
    * Look down, read, look up, then speak. Don't speak at your notes. 
    * Keep your notes near your eyes (in hand, or if Zoom on keyboard)
* Voice
    * Speak in phrases, not word by word
    * Interesting voice! 
    * Practice until you have few hesitations
