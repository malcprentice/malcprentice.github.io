# Cite using Sentence Style

## Careful! 
* This is the more difficult style. [Cite Brackets Style](Invention-CiteBracketsStyle) is easier
* You can't use most of these styles without an author name:
    * Wrong: ~~According to "Title," (n.d.),~~ penguins are cute.
    * Either use brackets: Penguins are cute ("Title," n.d.)
    * Or change them and ALSO use brackets at end: According to an article in the Mainichi Daily, penguins are cute ("Title," n.d.).

## Pattern 2: NVF (Name-Verb-Finding)

|Name                    |Verb           |Finding
|---                     |---            |---    
|Smith (1999)            |stated (that)  |X is Y
|Smith (1999, p. 31)     |found (that)   |not all X are Y
|Smith and Jones (2001)  |noted (that)    |"QUOTE"

## Pattern 3: ANVCF (As-Name-Verb-Comma-Finding)

|Preposition |Name                   |Verb       |Finding
|---         |---                    |---        |---         
|As          |Smith (1999)           |stated,    |X is Y
|            |Smith (1999, p. 31)    |found,     |not all X are Y
|            |Smith and Jones (2001) |noted,     |"QUOTE"

## Pattern 4: INCF (Intro-Name-Comma-Finding)

|Intro           |Name WITH COMMA        |Finding
|---             |---                    |---
|According to    |Smith (1999),          |X is Y
|In the words of |Smith (1999, p. 31),   |not all X are Y
|To quote        |Smith and Jones (2001), |"QUOTE"

## Pattern 5: SNVF (Source Type - Name - Verb - Finding)

|Source  |Type                   |Name                   |Verb (that)    |Finding
|---     |---                    |---                    |---            |---

## Pattern 6: NCMCVF (Name - Comma - Method - Comma - Verb- Finding)

|Source                  |Comma-Method-Comma                              |Verb (+ that)  |Finding
|---                     |---                                             |---            |--- 
|Smith (1999)            |, having interviewed 12 university students,    |said that      |X is Y
|Smith (1999, p. 31)     |, in a review of the literature on  dyslexia,   |found that     |not all X are Y
|Smith and Jones (2001)  |, using a survey of 134 High school students,   |noted          |"QUOTE"


## Pattern 7: The "We already know which source you mean" pattern
* TOEFL gives only one text
    * Use "The" or "This" reading/talk/etc
    * Not "A" reading/talk/etc  
* After RR talk
    * We know which TED Talk you mean
    * Use "the talk" and "the speaker, not "a talk" or "A speaker"

|Intro       |Source Comma       |We know         |Summary type.           |Optional Second part     
|---         |---                |---             |---                     |---
|In *this*   |article,           |*the* author    |argues that X           |, adding that Y 
|In *the*    |video,             |*the* speaker   |suggests that X         |, and added that Y 
|In *this*   |set of materials,  |*the* speaker   |                        | 


|Intro       |Source Type            |Summary type.                  |Optional Second part     
|---         |---                    |---                            |---
|*The*       |TED talk               |suggests that Y                |, concluding that Y
|            |article                |describes NOUN                 |, sharing the example of Y
|            |author                 |said that QUOTE                |, and suggested that
|*This*      |book                   |lists three X - 1, 2, and 3    |- and ends by noting Y
|            |lecture                |listed three X - 1, 2, and 3   |- and ended by noting Y


    
                        
                                
 
## Pattern 8: Inserted method
You can also insert methods into other sentences. 

* For example, pattern 2 with inserted method
    * Smith (1999) found, using a survey of 134 High school students, that X is Y
    * Smith (1999) discovered, using a autobiographical diary study, that X is Y
    * Smith (1999) surveyed 230 University student, and discovered that X is Y
* For example, using "and" or "ing"
    * Smith (1999) did an interview study, and found that X is Y
    * Smith (1999) did an interview study, find ing that X is Y

## Pattern 9: Block quote

Blockquotes are for quotes longer than 40 words:

* no quotes
* indented
* with one line space before and after
* citation in brackets at end of last line

blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
 
 

>I noticed in the Chinese class that when we did have a pause...I was very relieved to have a little break. If I hadn't noticed that, I would have carried on worrying about pauses in my own teaching. (Lowe, 1987, p. 93)

 

Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

## Common Mistakes
* In sentence style, author is part of the sentence, often the subject (主語), so:
    * the grammar must match
    * use "and" not "&"
