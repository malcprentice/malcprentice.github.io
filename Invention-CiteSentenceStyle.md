Invention-CiteSentenceStyle

# Careful! 
* This is the more difficult style. [Cite Brackets Style](Invention-CiteBracketsStyle) is easier
* The citation is now part of the sentence, often the subject (主語) of the sentence, so the grammar must match. 
* You can't use this style with titles
    * ~~According to "Title," n.d.,~ penguins are cute.
    * Penguins are cute ("Title," n.d.)



 


# Bored of "said"?
* Choose based on your field (Brexina, 2012)

        * Also used: claimed, said, remarked, maintained, showed, proposed, stressed, mentioned
    * Science Writers 
        * use fewer verbs more often:
        * Most common: pointed out, showed
        * Also used: argued, emphasized, observed, discussed
* Choose based on  confidence
    * "I and the author are both confident":
        * said, mentioned, observed             
        * concluded, wrote

        * proposed, hypothesized, postulated, contended       
        * indicated, estimated, asserted

## Common mistakes
* Careful of verb choice
    * Don't use "suggested that" if it's not a suggestion. 
    * Don't use "found that" if it's not a finding (a research result) 
    * If it doubt, use "said"
* Careful of verb tense choice
    * Is it true, relevant, and recent? Maybe use present (says) or perfect (has said). Maybe!
    * Otherwise (and if in doubt) use past ("said")
* Never use 
    * Opinion verbs: guessed, thought
    * Phrasal verbs: came up with, worked out, found out
    * Slang verbs: reckoned, figured
