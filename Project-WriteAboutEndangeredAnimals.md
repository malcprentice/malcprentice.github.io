# Project - Endangered Animals Essay

## Step 1: Choose an endangered animal
* Browse some animals
    * [WWF list](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?sort=extinction_status&direction=desc)
    * [IUCN Red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org/search?taxonLevel=Amazing&searchType=species)
* Choose ONE animal
    * Choose something INTERESTING we DO NOT KNOW (i.e. NOT the Giant Panda)
    * Do NOT choose Narwhal (the example essay topic)
    * Choose a SPECIFIC species (i.e. "Amur Tiger", not just "Tiger")
    * DO NOT choose animals that are "extinct" or "extinct in wild". Stick to "Critically endangered", "Endangered", "Vulnerable" or "Least concern"

## Step 2 - Homework
* Read the [example](Examples-EndangeredAnimalsEssay.md)
* Read two articles about your animal.
    * Japanese OK (except advanced classes). 
    * Take notes. 
    * If animal doesn't have 3 problems, maybe change your topic. 
    * If animal doesn't have 3 solutions, maybe change your topic. 
    * [Find good sources](Invention-FindGoodSources)

## Step 3 - Read more and start writing
* Read two more articles.  
    * English only 
    * Take notes
    * You will write 2 sentences about each problem and solution. Do you have enough materials? If not read more articles (Japanese OK)! 

## Tips on Arrangement 

We will write four or five paragraphs. Example has five paragraphs. 

* Write an Introduction Paragraph
* ~~Write a Description Paragraph (optional)~~
* Write a Problems (Cause-Effect) paragraph - see also write a cause-effect paragraph
* Write a Solutions (Summary-Response) Paragraph
* Write a Conclusion paragraps

## Tips for Invention
If you can't find a problem in the articles you read, try searching for problem keywords AND the name of your animal. 

__Remember that your solutions and problems don't need to match exactly. For example, fixing deforestation fixes hunting (no forest roads, less hunters).  __

* Common problem keywords are
    * habitat destruction
    * overdevelopment
    * tourism
    * deforestation
    * climate change
    * pollution
    * invasive species
    * land animals mostly: hunting, or poaching(illegal hunting)
    * sea animals mostly: bioaccumulation, bycatch, overfishing, boatstrike
    * indirect problems (things that make the problem worse) conflict, corruption
    * big mammals: traditional medicine
* Common solution keywords are
    * NGOs for animal (Save the Tiger), habitat (Mangrove Action PRoject), or general (WWF)
    * Wildlife preserves
    * Farmer compensation
    * Ecotourism
    * Sustainable Development
    * Laws (national, international, trade agreements like CITES)
    * Consumer awareness (if animal or habitat is part of food production) e.g. dolphin-safe tuna


## Tips for Style

* You're talking about ALL of an animal group. 
    * You can talk about the animalS or THE species. Don't mix
    * Plurals or 'the'. 
        * Emperor penguins enjoy eating ice cream
        * Emperor penguins ~~enjoys~~ eating ice cream
        * The Emperor penguin enjoys eating ice cream

        * The Emperor penguin eats fish, so ~~they like~~ sushi a lot
* Capitals for place names NOT for animal name
    * Amur tiger, Siberian tiger, Malaysian elephant, Bornean orangutan
    * ~~amur Tiger, siberian tiger, Malaysian Elephant, Bornean Orangutan~~
* Avoid definitions for animals that are defined by name
    * "The Saola is a kind of deer that lives in Vietnam"
    * ~~"The Siberian tiger is a kind of tiger that lives in Siberia"~~ 
    * Use partition instead for animals, use the family and a different fact
        * "There are seven kinds of tiger, of which the Siberian...."
        * "The Siberian tiger is the only member of the big cat family which plays tennis"
* Also
