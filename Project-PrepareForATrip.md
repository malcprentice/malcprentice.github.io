# Projects - Plan a Trip for Someone

Problem solving group activity - plan a "dream trip" for someone. You have 30 mins to research, then you will present your ideas to the class.  


## Example
* Polar bear
    * "I want to see a polar bear in the wild"
    * 10 days
    * Any country with bears OK. 
* Europe and a phobia
    * "I want to see as much Europe as possible, but I hate flying, so I want to fly as little as possible"
    * 30 days graduation trip
    * Winter only
    * Trains and buses preferred
* "I want to see my favourite football team play
    * 10 days in Barcelona
    * Include at least one game
* "I like weird attractions, and I'll be in UCLA for a study abroad next semester"
    * Two or three weekend trips, spread across a 3-4 month stay.
    * Accessible from Los Angeles, 1-2 nights away maximum 
    * Examples of weird given "like mystery houses, haunted places, magnetic hills, that kind of thing"
* "I want to hand feed a red panda"
    * 10 days
    * No other requirement. Just feed a panda. 
* Your own idea. 

## 3) Research you could do to inform the trip
* Preparation 
    * Visas
    * Language: Is English enough? Or will you need phrasebook
    * Customs: What customs/manners/cultural things do I need to know? What are people like?
    * Packing: What do I need to take? (special clothes/medicine
    * Warnings: Are there any dangers? (food/water/place/animal/diseases/people/time)
    * Can you think of any more things you might need to know?
* Itinerary
    * Plane or train?
    * Boarding / Departing / Arriving times. 
    * Commuting (i.e. how to get to airport) 
    * Other things you can do/eat/see/buy (as travel) while you are there
* Budget:
    * Transport
    * Accomodation
    * Food and Drink
    * Entry fees
    * Permits and visas
    * Is special insurance needed?
