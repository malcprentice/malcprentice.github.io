# Style - Use Academic Writing Style

*  Some rules for formal academic writing. 
    *  Not all of them apply in all majors. 
    *  For example, Engineering is usually stricter on using "I" than Education.

## Do not use "I"
* "This essay argues"
* "This essay has showed"
* Using your own experience as an example is OK
	*  Still, don't use "I" - use "The author was/went/saw"
	*  But even, then, only talk about facts, not opinions i.e. never use "The author believes/thinks"
* Sometimes "I" is OK in SOME majors IF YOU ARE PART OF THE RESEARCH CONTEXT e.g. Education ("In my class")
        
## Do not use "you" or "we"

Unless you mean EVERYONE:

* "We did a survey"                __bad, because "we" = your research team, not the reader__
* "We must protect the planet"     __OK, because "we" = all humans__
* "After that, you should look at" __bad, because "you" means the reader__
* "When you study English, you also learn culture" __only OK if essay is aimed at all and only students__
* __It's safer just to avoid "we" and "you" completely.__
	* Use passive ("A survey was done", "must be protected", "should be looked at"
	* third person ("The authors did a survey", "People should protect", "Future researchers should look at"
	* "it is" ("It is necessary to protect", "It is recommended to look at"
	* FOr example

## Do not use digits under 10
* Use words for 1-9  ("one two three")
* Use numbers for 10+ ("10, 11, 12")
* However
	* If the number starts a sentence, use "Twelve" or "Around 12"
	* Use numbers with counters ($3, 8 hours, 5 years old)
	* Keep numbers consistent (8-10, not 8-ten)

## Do not use abbreviations (e.g. "don't" = do not)
* No short forms (don’t, won’t, can’t, isn’t, he’s, etc.) in essays.
* Use long forms (do not, will not, cannot, is not, he is, etc.)


## Do not use anonymous sources
*  ~~Many people think~~
*  ~~It is thought that~~
* ~~It is said that~~

* Instead [SAY WHO SAID IT](Invention-CitationGeneralRules)

## No opinion adjecitves
* Just give the facts, not your attitude to them. 
	* ~~obviously~~
	* ~~surprisingly~~
	* ~~amazingly~~
* It is your READERS job to decide if the idea is clear or amazing.  
* See [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Words_to_watch)

## No rhetorical questions ("Do you know the red panda?")
* A rhetorical question is one you answer yourself.
* ~~"Why is the panda extinct? Well, mostly because..."~~
* These are OK in lectures/presentations, not formal academic essays
