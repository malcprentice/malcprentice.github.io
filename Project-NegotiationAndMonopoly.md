# Project - Negotiation and Monopoly 

We're going to practice negotiating language using Monopoly. The rules are similar to "Jinsei Game". I will explain in class.


## Background
* We're doing this to practice negotiation language
* However, remember this game was designed as a [CRITICISM of how rent works](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20170728-monopoly-was-invented-to-demonstrate-the-evils-of-capitalism) 
    * Everyone loses, except one very rich person and the bank
    * Rich people can buy their way out of jail. Poor people get stuck.
    * There is an artificial housing shortage to keep rent high
    * Housing is slowly replaced by hotels to make more money
* (It's famous for making people angry at their family and friends.)

## Rules
* Each player gets $1500 
* One player is Banker. Can play, but keep money separate
* When you land on a square, either 
    * Instruction? Follow it (Take Chance card, Go to Jail, etc)
    * Property? 
        * If ot owned
            * Buy it yourself
            * Don't buy it. Bank will auction (オークション) 
        * If owned
            * Pay rent (家賃) to owner
            * Negotiate rent if you have something they want
* Aim is to charge so much rent that other players go bankrupt (破産)
    * Buy a whole area (same colour)
        * Rent doubles
        * You can build houses/hotels
    * Winner is
        * Last player who hasn't gone bankrupt
        * THe richest when time runs out. 
* Strange rules
    * If you throw doubles 3 times, you go to jail 
    * When you pass “GO” space, Banker gives you $200 salary.
    * You have to ASK for your rent. If you forget, no rent. 
    * To get out of jail, 
        * pay 
        * roll a double on your turn (3 chances, then pay anyway). 
        * Buy a card from another player. 
* If you run out of money:
    * You can sell "get out of jail" cards
    * You can mortgage (抵当)  your property to bank. 
        * But then you stop getting rent. 
        * And you have to pay 10% more to get it back
    * You can sell property to other players (negotiate)
    * You can sell houses/hotels for 50% of what you paid. 
* There are [some other rules](https://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/00009.pdf)
    * However, they don't add to the game much 
    * Most people who play make up or drop some rules. As long as everyone knows them it's OK. 






## Game language

* Your turn.
* Is it my turn?
* Can you move my token 3 squares? It's the boot.
* Can you pass me a chance card?
* Can you pass the dice?
* I'd like to buy this property please
* That's mine. Please pay $32 ("32 dollars") rent
* Here you are.

## Banker language
* Would you like to buy it?
* Here you are.
* If you want to get out of jail, you can pay...

 
## Proposal (offer, suggestion)
* If you give me X I will give you Y (high chance of X)
* I'll give you two choices - either X or Y
* I propose we swap/exchange/VERB
* How about we swap/exchange/VERB
* Would it be possible to add X to the deal
* How would you feel if we Xed...
* What do you think about Xing
* How about you X and I Y?

## Checking at the end of a long proposal
* Is that OK with you?
* How does that sound?
* Would that work?

## Clarifying a proposal
* So, you mean....
* XXXX - that's correct, isn't it?
* Could you just summarise that for me one more time?
* Can you give me an example? 

## Asking for more room or time
* I'll have to check/think. Give me a second
* Are you flexible on that number?
* Would you be willing to...
* Could we compromise on...


## Refusing
* I'm sorry, but that doesn't work for me.
* I don't think that's going to work.
* I'm afraid we can't do that.
* Unfortunately, that's not quite...
* That's a fair offer, but... 
* That would be quite difficult.

## Accepting
* Great!
* Done!
* Deal!
* I believe we have a deal!
* That's sounds reasonable. Let's do it.

## Accepting with conditions
* Done, but only on the condition that X.
* OK, but we're going to have to insist that...
* As long as X, then we have a deal.
* We would be willing to accept that only if

## Counter proposal
* Instead,...
* May I offer an alternative?....
* THat might work. But perhaps ...

## Closing
* OK, just to check. You will... and we will...
* SO, what we agreed on was to X and Y
* Let's just summarise...
* Pleasure doing business with you.
