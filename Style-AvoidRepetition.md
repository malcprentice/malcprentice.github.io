# Avoid Repetition

A common style problem is using the same word too much.

## Example

There are many **children** who have to work at cotton fields because the **children's** household does not make much money. For example, in India, about 88% of the people working at cotton fields are **children**, from 6-14 years old. About 60% of the **children** are able to go to school at first, but they are forced to quit and have to work at the cotton fields ("Cotton industry and child labor," n.d.). In addition, 78% of these **children** are...


## Option 1: Use a pronoun
* Cats are cute. Cats are small
* Cats are cute. They are small

## Option 2: Join sentences and delete the subject

This also helps improve short sentences.

* Cats are cute. Cats are small
* Cats are cute and small

## Option 3: Use other words that mean the same
* e.g. Tokyo = "here", or "the city"
* e.g. think = "consider" or "ponder"

## Option 4: Use "these", "those"
* There are 14 shops in my area, and 12 of the shops are open today
* There are 14 shops in my area, and 12 of those are open today

## Option 5: "of which", "of whom"
* There are 14 shops in my area, and 12 shops are open today
* There are 14 shops in my area, 12 of which are open today
* There are 14 teachers in my area, and two teachers are retiring soon.
* There are 14 teachers in my area, two of whom are retiring soon.

## Example, fixed

* Some kinds of style 
    * "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness" â€” Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities"
    * There are the main issues with this: **failure to protect** animals, **failure to protect** the environment, and **failure to protect** workers.
