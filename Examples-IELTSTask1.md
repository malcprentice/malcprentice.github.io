## 3 paragraph, graph (Thanks to SN in 2021)

This line graph shows the change in population of the three generations between 1960 and 2060. Overall, the proportions of people aged 0-14 and 15-64 have been in decline since at least 1970, while the number of people aged 65 and over has been constantly increasing. 

Focusing first on the population changes from 1960 to the present for each of these groups, the proportion of those aged 0-14 has fallen from 30% to about 10%, while that of those aged 15-64 rose by about 5% between 1960 and 2000 but have since begun to decline gradually. In contrast, the number of people aged 65 and over has increased from less than 10% of the population to about 30% in the 60 years between 1960 and 2020.

The projections for the period from now to 2060 show that the population under 65 will continue to decline, while the population over 65 will continue to rise. The proportion of people aged 0-14 will be less than 10% in 2060, and the number of people in the 15-64 age group will decline to almost 60%. Conversely, it shows that the over 65 group will continue to grow and will account for 40% of the population by 2060.     (205 words)

## 4 paragraph Map Description

(Thanks to SN in 2021 for example)

This map shows how the school campus is planned to change in 2035. Overall, the changes will be dramatic, from the construction of new facilities to the removal, expansion, and conversion of existing buildings and equipment.Â 

It is clear that the main school building, combined with the new media centre, will be slightly less than double the size of the original. In contrast to the school building, the library and reception will remain unchanged in size and location.

The pond, trees and swimming pool in the north-east will be transformed into a large sports hall connected to the sports ground in 2035. The chapel and theatre in the centre of the north area will be replaced by one large assembly hall, which together with the dining hall will be attached to a larger hall in the new building.

One final point to note is the accessibility of the school. The main school gate at the southern end of the campus will be twice the size of the current gate. Similarly, there will be a new car gate situated at the southwest end leading into a driveway which will lead directly to an enlarged car park at the northwest.
