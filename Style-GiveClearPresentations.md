## Remember
* Keywords are best if they are NOUNS (ÂêçË©û) - don‚Äôt forget the "and".
* If you're using slides, don't use speakers notes
    * They almost never work properly
    * They make you look at the laptop too much 
* If you're using a script
    * Short easily read chunks
    * large font
    * Note cards, not floppy A4

## General Style Tips
* Present for other students, not Malc:
    * they didn't read what you did
    * define or avoid words they won‚Äôt know
* Make sure it is INTERESTING
* Any words hard to pronounce? 
    * If they're important, practice 
    * If not, replace them
* Use simple sentences you can remember
