	<li>	 Introduction and Literature Review 
		<ol>
		<li>	 Greeting: Hello, in this presentation students from the CLASS NAME will share a recent research topic </li>
		<li>	 GB: These days/Every day /All Soka students /   </li>
		<li>	 SB: One of the most  </li>
		<li>	 IB: This is a problem/ is important  </li>
		<li>	 Thesis: As such, in this research project we examined  </li>

</ol>
</li>	
<li>	 Lit Review 
		<ol>
		<li>	 Topic sentence: "Next, the literature review." </li>
		<li>	 Keyword sentence "This section will outline the existing literature on TOPIC / will look at three reasons why X is a problem / will summarise three important papers about TOPIC."  </li>
		<li>	 Structure sentence "The first main area/problem/paper is 1" 
			<ol>
			<li>	 Detail </li>
			<li>	 Detail </li>

<li>	 Structure sentence "However" or "In addition" or "The second main area/problem/paper is 2"

			<li>	 Detail </li>
			<li>	 Detail </li>

</li>		
<li>	 Structure sentence "However" or "In addition" or "The third main area/problem/paper is 3" 
			<ol>
			<li>	 Detail </li>
			<li>	 Detail </li>

</ol>
</li>		
<li>	 Transition to method by showing gap: e.g. "However, it is not clear how students actually use X, and therefore this research project aims to describe, as a case study, how one class of students use X" </li>

</ol>
</li>	
<li>	 Methods 
		<ol>
		<li>	 "Now I will describe the methods used." </li>
		<li>	 "First, the <strong> research framework. </strong> In general, this is a case study, a piece of qualitative descriptive research using a semi-structured interview to describe one group in detail as an example." </li>
		<li>	 "Next, <strong> participants and context. </strong> Interviewers each spoke to one classmate, for a total of ?? students from the ?? class, of whom ? were male and ?? were female. Participants were all ?-year students, aged ?? to ??. Of those, 4 were Law majors, 5 Economics, 2 Education, and 2 Literature majors. Participants were selected using a convenience sample, with pairs assigned at random." </li>
		<li>	 "Next, materials. The materials were designed as follows. Firstly, a list of possible questions were made, such as 1, 2, and 3. From these, ?? was chosen as the most important using a class vote. Then, the main questions were written, and some follow up questions were added in case interviewees did not answer in full. These questions were piloted, and some of them were changed to make the interview clearer. The question asked are on this slide. Finally they were asked for other comments." </li>
		<li>	 "Next, <strong> the procedure. </strong>  
			<ol>
			<li>	 If we did face to face: "First an appointment was made for each interview pair to meet in a quiet place before the interview. " </li>
			<li>	 If we did ethics: "At the beginning of the interview some small talk was done for a short time to relax them. Next they were informed about the length of the interview, the purpose of research, how anonymous they would be, when they would receive the data, and who would see the data. Then they asked for permission to start and recording began using recorders.  </li>
			<li>	 The interview schedule on this slide was followed. After the interview was over, they were thanked and asked if they had any questions.  </li>

</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>	
<li>	 Results 
		<ol>
		<li>	 Topic sentence "The results of interviews were as follows. There were 3/4/5/6/7/8/ main themes" </li>
		<li>	 "Firstly, THEME 1. SUmmary."  
			<ol>
			<li>	 "As this graph shows".  </li>
			<li>	 "Of the 10 students interviews, 8 said X" </li>
			<li>	 "All students who said yes also said that Y" </li>
			<li>	 "Of the students who said yes, 6 said X and 9 said Y"" </li>
			<li>	 One of the students who answered X said that "QUOTE EXACT WORDS" </li>
			<li>	 On the other hand, one of the students who answered Y said "QUOTE" </li>
			<li>	 However, the students who said Y noted that Z </li>
			<li>	 Only one said said Y. She said ... </li>
			<li>	 As this summary/graph/chart/diagram shows, 75%/half of students said X </li>
			<li>	 Meanwhile, only one student said Y </li>
			<li>	 One student, however, noted that Y </li>
			<li>	 Nearly all students chose "Effective" or "Mostly effective" </li>
			<li>	 All 16 students yes, of whom 7 said penguin and 8 said giraffe. However, one said chocolate." </li>
			<li>	 All 16 students yes, of whom 7 said penguin. Other answers included giraffe, hippo, and rhino" </li>
			<li>	 Please look at this pie chart / histogram / bar chart / etc. As you can see, X" </li>
			<li>	 Of the 16 students who answered yes, most spoke about Y. For example" </li>
			<li>	 For example, PSEUDONYM said QUOTE </li>
			<li>	 For example, PSEUDONYM said this. SHOW SLIDE WITH QUOTE AND PAUSE TO LET AUDIENCE READ </li>
			<li>	 This shows that </li>
			<li>	 This means that </li>
			<li>	 As such we can see that </li>
			<li>	 THis issue will be discussed later under "Limitations" </li>
			<li>	 Here's a full example: "The third item was eco bag. This pie chart shows the proportion of students who have an eco bag or not. 10 students answered they had one while the eight others didn't. The 10 students who had an eco bag were asked about how often they use it. As this graph shows, ten students use it either always or usually. One student who always uses an eco bag said that it was because “I don’t want to use plastic bags. Because they will be wasted.” On the other hand, one student who had said "never" made the comment “I always use my normal bag as eco bag instead.”. This  shows that some students who do not use eco bags are not necessarily using disposable plastic bags instead. We will talk about this in the "limitations" section later.    </li>

</ol>
</li>		
<li>	 "Secondly, THEME. SUmmary." Same as above </li>
		<li>	 "Next, THEME. SUmmary." Same as above </li>
		<li>	 OTHER: "When asked for additional comments on the research, three students gave their opinions. Here are all of those comments. The most interesting comment is  ... because ...  </li>

</ol>
</li>	
<li>	 Discussion 
		<ol>
		<li>	 Link "So what did we find out?" </li>
		<li>	 Topic sentence:  "This research project aimed to discover THESIS. In summary, SUMMARISE RESULTS.  </li>
		<li>	 Implications AKA Final Comment  
			<ol>
			<li>	 "As such, if a university student / a university /a wants to help, they should..." </li>
			<li>	 Based on the results this project, we recommend that  students can and should X. Specifically Y. </li>

</ol>
</li>		
<li>	 Limitations   
			<ol>
			<li>	 "This project had some limitations, in that" (e.g. not enough participants, sampling, ba dquestion writing, interviewee confusion, interviews were done differently for some reason, ) </li>
			<li>	 "This project had three main limitations. First," </li>

</ol>
</li>		
<li>	 Suggestions for future research (if different from limitations) 
			<ol>
			<li>	 Future research in this area should / should aim to determine X / shoudl first identify. IN addition. Therefore.  </li>
