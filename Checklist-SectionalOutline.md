    * Background - 1-3 paragraphs
    * Other sections - 2-3 paragraphs.  
* Are the sections and paragraphs in a sensible order 
    * e.g. time order
    * e.g. problems getting bigger from 1-3

* Don't forget the structure sentences. Don't delete them from the template
    * Check the start of sections and paragraphs.

        * Between different paragraphs (Similarities-Differences, Problem-Solution) you CAN have a link/summary, but it's not necessary, and only needed if _if the paragraph is really long_ 
    * Check the end of section. Except Intro and Conclusion you need both a link and a summary. No content, just plan to have one!
