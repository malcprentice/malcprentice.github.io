# When to use a definition
* In a description paragraph
* Maybe the Introduction, if you don't use it in Description. 
* If you are using a __normal__ word in a __special__ way
    * Happiness __is defined here as__   the emotional state which results from eating chocolate
    * Happiness __is here used to mean a__ score of 5 or higher on the self-assessment Satisfaction scale
    * Happiness __is operationalised as__ balance between positive and negative emotion (Ryff, 1989)

## Tips to help you understand
* A good definition defines ONLY ONE thing
    * "Tea is a soft drink made with hot water." is not good 
    * "Tea is a soft drink made from the leaves of Camellia Sinensis."
* Think of it as a reverse quiz question:
    * __Bad Question:__ What is a soft drink made with hot water?
    * __Answer:__ Um... Tea? Coffee? Hot lemon? 
    * __Good Question:__ What is a soft drink made from the leaves of Camellia Sinensis?
    * __Answer:__ Tea
* Look at the first sentence or two of any Wikipedia article - it is usually a definition
    * Gold is a chemical element  with symbol Au and atomic number 79.
    * Paper is a thin material produced by pressing together moist fibres...
    * Economics  is the social science that describes  the factors that determine ...

## Common mistakes
* Con't copy a definition from a dictionary". Do you own research.
* Don't define obvious things. We know what gold is. Maybe define CONFLICT gold instead.
* Don't define things with words from the name ~~"The Malaysian tiger is a tiger from Malaysia"~~
