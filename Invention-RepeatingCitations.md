# Invention - Repeating Citations

## Imagine you have three sentences, each with a fact 
 
> Medium size dogs like the Shiba usually weigh up to 11kg (Suzuki, 2020). However, smaller ones like the Chihuahua can weigh less than 3 kg. Meanwhile, large ones like the Akita often weigh up to 60kg (Yamashita, 2021).


Question: __Where did the 3kg fact come from? Suzuki or Yamashita?__ Source of facts should always be clear. There are three fixes for this:

## Easy Fix 1 - just repeat the citation (not good style)
>Medium size dogs like the Shiba usually weigh up to 11kg (Suzuki, 2020). However, smaller ones like the Chihuahua can weigh less than 3 kg __(Suzuki, 2020).__ Meanwhile, large ones like the Akita often weigh up to 60kg (Yamashita, 2021).

* This is OK if you do it once. 
* If you do it 3+ times in a short paragraph, itâ€™s not good style

## Easy Fix - join sentence 1 and 2. Move citation to end of new longer sentence
> Medium size dogs like the Shiba usually weigh up to __11kg, however__ smaller ones like the Chihuahua can weigh less than 3 kg __(Suzuki, 2020).__ Meanwhile, large ones like the Akita often weigh up to 60kg (Yamashita, 2021).

* OK for short simple sentences
* Not for long sentences - the grammar will probably break.
