* Too few questions in sections 3(Conversations), 6 (Text Completion), and 7(Passages)
* Missing 'image' questions in section 3 aqnd 4.

## General exam tips - be prepared. A story:
> When I went to my first language test in a while a few years ago, I made a lot of mistakes. The exam was being held at a university in Tokyo. I arrived, then realised I had the wrong campus. I barely made it to the right campus in time. I had the wrong pencil for the grammar section ( no sharp-pencils allowed), the wrong kind of pen for the writing (no frixion allowed), and the battery on my watch (which I never usually use) had run out. Don't be like me! Prepare the right things in advance, and check everything twice.

## Listening Tips
* Questions are in order (answer to first question is at beginning of listening)
* Answer as quickly as you can, then read the next question. Try to guess what is coming.
* Answer every question - wrong answer do not get minus points
* For section 3/4, answer the easy questions first.

## Reading tips
* Questions are in order (answer to first question is at beginning of text)
* Plan your time for each section.
	* 30s max per question for section 5/6
	* 60s max per question for section 7
* Answer every question - wrong answer do not get minus points
* Skip difficult ones and come back at the end.
* For part 7, read the questions first
