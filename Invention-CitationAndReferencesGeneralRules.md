# Citation And References - General Rules


## What is this? Style overview
As a rough guide (it depends on the department / journal), some  styles you might see are:

* [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org)  -  Psychology, some Linguistics, Journalism, Education, some Engineering
* [MLA](https://www.mla.org/MLA-Style) - Communication, Theater, Philosophy
* [Chicago](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org)  - History, Art, Music, Economics
* [Bluebook](http://www.legalbluebook.com/)  - US Law
* [AMA](http://healthlinks.washington.edu/hsl/styleguides/ama.html) - US Medicine


## Brackets or Sentence style?
* Brackets style is easier
    * It looks like this (Suzuki, 2021) or this ("Title," 2021, April) 
    * The ONLY option for sources with no author name and presentation slides
    * For details, see [Cite Brackets Style](Invention-CiteBracketsStyle)
* Sentence style is more difficult but better style. 
        * It looks like this
            * According to Suzuki (2021)  
            * Suzuki (2021, April 13) says that 
        * DO NOT use it unless there is a NAME - so no titles. And don't use it on presentation slides. 
        * For details, see [Cite Sentence Style](Invention-CiteSentenceStyle)
        * You also need [Citation Verb options](Invention-CitationVerbs)

## Step 2 - what is it? 
* How to do it depends on what it is. 
    * [Cite a Book](Invention-CiteABook)
    * [Cite a Journal Article](Invention-CiteAJournalArticle)
    * [Cite a News Article](Invention-CiteANewsArticle)
    * [Cite a Video](Invention-CiteAVideo)
    * [Cite a Website](Invention-CiteAWebsite)
* If you copy the example exactly, you will have no problems. 
    * But no-one ever copies it exactly. 
    * For common mistakes, check the Invention checklist (at the end of the essay checklist I will send) 
    * For less common rules, try [Other Rules](Invention-CitationAndReferencesOtherRules)
* Be aware, it's important to note 
    * Does it have an author name or not
    * Does it have a date or not
    * Is it available in paper (like Yomiuri Shimbun) or not (liek BBC News)
