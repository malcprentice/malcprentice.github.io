# Citation And References - General Rules


## What is this? Style overview
As a rough guide (it depends on the department / journal), some  styles you might see are:

* [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org)  -  Psychology, some Linguistics, Journalism, Education, some Engineering
* [MLA](https://www.mla.org/MLA-Style) - Communication, Theater, Philosophy
* [Chicago](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org)  - History, Art, Music, Economics
* [Bluebook](http://www.legalbluebook.com/)  - US Law
* [AMA](http://healthlinks.washington.edu/hsl/styleguides/ama.html) - US Medicine


## APA: Brackets and Sentence styles
* Brackets style is easier
    * e.g. (Suzuki, 2021) or  ("Title," 2021, April) 
    * The ONLY option for sources with no author name and presentation slides
    * For details, see [Cite Brackets Style](Invention-CiteBracketsStyle)
* Sentence style is more difficult  
        * e.g. "According to Suzuki (2021)" or ".., however Suzuki (2021, April 13) notes that"
        * Must have a NAME
            * Can't say ~~"According to "Penguins" (n.d.)~~
            * Have to say "According to an article in the Asahi Shimbun about penguins ("Penguins," n.d.)
        * ...so you can't use it on presentation slides. 
        * For details, see [Cite Sentence Style](Invention-CiteSentenceStyle) 

## Real World Examples 
* Find "Google Scholar"
* Search your favourite topic from your major
* Find a source that says "PDF"
* Download it. 
* Look at the citations in the paragraphs. 
    * Is it APA? 
    * Can you find an example of "Brackets style"  
    * Can you find and example of "Sentence style"  


## How to do it. 
* Decide what it is, then follow the example carefully. 
    * [Cite a Book](Invention-CiteABook)
    * [Cite a Journal Article](Invention-CiteAJournalArticle)
    * [Cite a News Article](Invention-CiteANewsArticle)
    * [Cite a Video](Invention-CiteAVideo)
    * [Cite a Website](Invention-CiteAWebsite)
* If you copy the example exactly, you will have no problems. 
    * But no-one ever copies it exactly. 
    * For common mistakes, check the Invention checklist (at the end of the essay checklist I will send) 
    * For less common rules, try [Other Rules](Invention-CitationAndReferencesOtherRules)
* Be aware, it's important to note 
    * Does it have an author name or not
    * Does it have a date or not
    * Is it available in paper (like Yomiuri Shimbun) or not (liek BBC News)
  


## Tools to help you
There are also some tools you can use, but be careful 
* THey are not really useful for first year essays. They are useful is:
    *  you are doing a 100 page dissertaion 
    *  you are switching from APA to MLA a lot 
* Be careful
    * They often make mistakes with page numbers, title case, and non-English names
    * Learn to do it manually first.
* THe most common free ones are
    * [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) (recommended option)
    * [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)
* If you just want to check one citation, also try:
    * [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.jp) (click the quotemark)
    * [BibMe](http://www.bibme.org)
