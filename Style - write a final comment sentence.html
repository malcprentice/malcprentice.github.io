        	<p>	"Final comment" could also be called "a conclusion", but </p>
<ul><li>	we also call the paragraph "a conclusion" </li>
<li>	the last part of non-academic essays is not always a conclusion - for example, sometimes it is a quote. </li>
<li>	So, I call this part the "final comment" to avoid confusion </li>

</ul>

<h4>	Final comments should be aimed at the READER </h4>
	<p>	The reader is a student in Japan, so try "Japanese students / People in Japan / Students in Soka University... who want to help should" </p>
<ul><li>	Don't use "The Japanese government should" or "Convenience stores should"  </li>
<li>	Instead say that "People who want to help should write to their local politician / Lawson head office and demand that" </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	Final comments for your essays should be PRACTICAL  </h4>
	<p>	I recommend you stick to things you or people you know can do </p>
<ul><li>	should donate </li>
<li>	should volunteer </li>
<li>	should write a protest letter to  </li>
<li>	should buy </li>
<li>	should stop buying </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	Final comments are also SPECIFIC.  </h4>
<ul><li>	Don't just tell me to donate. Tell me WHO to donate to. Give me the donation link. </li>
<li>	Don't tell me buy Fairtrade. Tell me where I can get it online/in Tokyo/ on Campus </li>

<h4>	CAUSE EFFECT signals </h4>

<ul><li>	It must come JUST AFTER a summary of your evidence </li>
<li>	e.g. "In summary..... As a result of these points, it is recommended that". </li>

	<p>	Not every paragraph or section gets a final comment. For example in a dissertation, you would expect a final comment </p>
<ul><li>	At the end of the introduction and literature review, giving decisions made about research methods or questions </li>
<li>	SEVERAL in the discussion chapter, giving implications of the study, what to do in future research, what not to do, etc. </li>
