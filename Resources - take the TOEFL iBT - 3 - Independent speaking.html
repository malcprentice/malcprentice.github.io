	<p>	1) You only have 15s to prepare. Jot down some ideas. </p>
	<p>	2) Speak for the full 45s   </p>
<ul><li>	 There will be a timer in the title bar. </li>
<li>	 Practice with your phone </li>

</ul>	<p>	3) Do not give an outline (I have two reasons, X and Y). </p>
<ul><li>	 Most example answers do not include one, and it takes too much time. </li>
<li>	 Focus on content and transitions. </li>

</ul>	<p>	4) This is a speaking test - use informal speech. </p>
<ul><li>	 Especially, use contractions (it’s, they’re) </li>
<li>	 Example responses avoid formal signalling like “In summary” - these are for writing </li>

</ul>	<p>	5) Practice using the right tense, conditionals </p>
<ul><li>	 Do you prefer  =   I prefer </li>
<li>	 Would you prefer   =   I would prefer </li>
<li>	 Why did you X  =   I Xed because </li>
<li>	 Why are you Xing?  =   I am Xing because next year I will Y </li>

</ul>	<p>	6) Study Tips for all speaking (independent AND integrated) </p>
<ul><li>	 Record yourself speaking. </li>
<ul><li>	 Transcribe yourself and look for problems </li>
<li>	 Do the same speech again and again - faster and smoother </li>
</ul><li>	 See  <a href="http://www.ets.org/s/toefl"> (link) </a> for example answers </li>
<li>	 Don’t repeat to fill time </li>
<ul><li>	 add something </li>
