        	<p>	One common report you might be asked to do when you start work is a criteria-analysis </p>
	<p>	For example, when the university made GLobal Square, they had to buy hundreds of projectors.  </p>
	<p>	How did they choose from the many available?  </p>
	<p>	Probably, someone was asked to  </p>
	<p>	1) Choose criteria (bright, cheap, reliable,) </p>
	<p>	2) Get information on many projectors </p>
	<p>	3) Narrow it down to a few </p>
	<p>	4) Write a report recommending ONE projector, with reasons.  </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Invention">	 Invention </h2>
<ul><li>	 For topics, think about: </li>
<ul><li>	 Something you need to buy (mobile phone) </li>
<li>	 Something you need to choose (study abroad, company) </li>
<li>	 Something Japan needs to decide (olympic stadium designs) </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 For criteria: </li>
<ul><li>	 DON'T choose boring criteria (e.g. cost)  </li>
<li>	 choose something that needs research </li>
<li>	 choose something that needs thought </li>

<ul><li>	 There is no outline template </li>

	<p>	Keywords for your Analysis paragraphs bend the normal rules. They are <strong> actions. </strong>  </p>

<ul><li>	 e.g. you used the criteria price, taste, and health to analyse strawberries, bananas and apples using the criteria </li>
<li>	 I should be able to use the SAME criteria paragraphs/slides to analyse pineapples, oranges, and grapes. Without changing them </li>
<li>	 Remember: DO NOT mention the thing/.things you are analysingin your criteria section </li>

<h4>	 Use hedging </h4>
	<p>	Many of you analyses will not be completely certain </p>
	<p>	Try to use hedging<red> Work in Progress!!!</red> </p>
<ul><li>	 "Is not effective" is usually too strong. Instead try: </li>
<li>	 "not particularly effective" </li>

<li>	 See previous essays for how to write process/definition/partition/comparison sentences </li>
<li>	 Link at end of description paragraph ("Now that X has been described, the following three paragraphs will analyse it in terms of the criteria described above - 1, 2, and 3.") </li>
