# Writing good DISCUSSION questions
A good discussion questions asks about OPINION or EXPERIENCE or PLANS.

* This is not a quiz. No questions that have correct answers
   * How many people live in Tokyo?
   * What is the capital of Yemen?
* This is not a dissertation (論文). No questions that need research
   * How can we reduce water pollution in Bangladesh?
   * What is the solution to poverty in Vietnam?
* No questions with obvious answers. 
   * Have you ever been to Paraguay?
   * Do you think war is bad?
* No lazy questions. The following are BANNED.
   * "Do you know TOPIC" (Of course they do! You just explained it!)
   * "What do you think about TOPIC?"
   * "What is your image of TOPIC" 
   * "How do you feel about TOPIC"
   * Instead, be specific e.g. "Do you think that X is Y?"
* If I ask you to write three questions, they must start three different discussions. 
   * 1) Do you like dogs
   * 2) Do you want dogs
   * 3) Do you have dogs
