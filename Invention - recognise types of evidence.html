        <h2 id=" Types of evidence">	 Types of evidence </h2>
	<p>	“Is the Loch Ness Monster real or not” </p>
	<p>	
<table border="1">  <tr><td>Reason 	</td><td>"Loch Ness is very narrow, so where would it hide?"</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Report 	</td><td>"My cousin said he saw it" (personal report) <br> "It was seen by person X on date Y" (testimony)</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Research</td><td>"The BBC used 600 submarines and found nothing":  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3096839.stm</td></tr>"> (link) </a> </p>
</table><br>	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 Reason/Report without Research is weak </li>
<ul><li>	 "Loch Ness is very narrow"? yes, but also very deep, so it's easy to hide </li>
<li>	 "My cousin said"? OK, but maybe my cousin is lying, or wrong. </li>
</ul><li>	 Research without Reason/Report is boring </li>
<li>	 A good essay uses Research linked by Reasons.  </li>
<li>	 Personal Report is not allowed in academic essays. Cite testimony or it didn't happen. </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>

<h2 id=" Example Evidence">	 Example Evidence </h2>
<h4>	 “We should do a study abroad” </h4>
	<p>	1. If we go to Canada, we will have to speak English, so our level will go up.      </p>
	<p>	2. My friend said that the food she ate on a study abroad was terrible. </p>
	<p>	3. Study abroad is too expensive - 300000/week (http://www.studyabroad.co.jp) </p>
	<p>	4. My friend went on a study abroad and made new friends from many countries. </p>
	<p>	5. When we travel, people we meet learn about Japan and maybe want to visit. More tourists = good economy </p>
	<p>	6. Other countries are dangerous. According to the LAPD, there were over 1000 murders in 1993 (http://www.laalmanac.com/crime/cr02.html) </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 For each piece of evidence above, decide </h4>
	<p>	1. Is it Reason, Report or Research?  </p>
	<p>	2. Is it FOR or AGAINST doing a study abroad? </p>
	<p>	3. Write a keyword for each piece of evidence. </p>
	<p>	4. Is it strong? How could you argue against this evidence? </p>
