# Project - Study Skills Review

## Step 1: Set Goals
Split your goals to make a plan
Set LONG, MEDIUM and SHORT term goals for study and life

* Example 1
    * LONG: I want to run a marathon!
    * MEDIUM: Run 5km without stopping by the end of Semester.
    * SHORT: Run 1km tomorrow. Eat only healthy bento this week.
* Example 2
    * LONG: I want to do a Masters degree in a good US university
    * MEDIUM: TOEFL iBT 100 by 4th year. Save money.
    * SHORT: Buy a TOEFL book. Get a part time job. 


### Discuss! Ask your partner
* What is your long term goal?
    * e.g. What is your dream?
    * e.g. Who do you want to be like? (your role model)
    * e.g. What do you want to AVOID becoming? 
* What is your medium term plan
    * e.g. for this semester
    * e.g. by 4th year
* What are your short term actions 
    * tomorrow
    * this week

## Step 2: Manage Time
* Time management is the main reason students fail courses
* If you keep forgetting your homework (or doing it at 4am), something is wrong

### Discuss!
* What is your time management system?
    * A diary you check regularly. 
    * Reminder apps with notifications
    * Post-its on your bedroom wall
    * Whiteboard on your bedroom wall
    * Calendar apps with reminders 
    * Email (email yourself everything e.g. "buy bread") and try to empty your inbox  
* Is it working? (Or are you doing homework, stressed, at 4am)

## Stay Motivated
* Above, you learned to make a plan and manage time. 
    * However, when your diary/plan tells you to do something, you often don't want to. 
    * Here are some tricks
* Trick 1: Set a Timer
    * Set a timer for 10/20/30 minutes
    * Study for at least that long
    * Take a break when the timer goes off
 
* Trick 2: Starting is hardest. So just do easy step 1 and stop. 
    * Trick your brain into starting by pretending you're not doing anything difficult. 
    * e.g. Make a plan to open your essay and ONLY write the title.
    * Promise yourself you can stop after the title
    * But you might find it's easy to keep going
    * e.g. Pack a bag and go to the Library (or Gym)
    * Promise yourself you ONLY need to go, you don't need to stay
    * But after you get there, it's easy to continue
* Trick 3: Don't Break the Chain.
    * 1) Get a Calendar
        * A big paper calendar that goes in front of your desk
        * An App for tracking several things.  
    * 2) Cross off every day you study
    * 3) Do not break your streak! Link in Japanese: (link)
* Trick 4: Compete
    * Compete with yourself
    * Track your important scores (QW word count, time to run 5km, study time)
    * There are apps for exercise: steps walked (FitBit), cycling distance (Strava)
    * Keep a chart. There are lots of apps for this, but paper is sometimes easier.
    * Every week, try to beat yourself (less TV, faster 5km, more words)
    * Also compete with others!
    * Every week, try to beat your friends
* Trick 5: Form a Study Group
    * If someone is waiting for you, you have to go study.
    * If you don't understand, someone else does
    * Combine it with tracking (Trick 4)
    * Compete with your friends! Who can study the most?
    * Compete with other groups! Which group can study the most?
    * If you can't meet in person, try an app e.g. Memrise
* Trick 6: Reduce Distractions
    * Put your phone in Airplane mode (no notifications)
    * Go to the library.
    * Give your game machine controllers to someone until after the exam
    * Use a browser plugin (NoScript) to break distracting websites
    * Don't go too far with this - you need to relax occasionally.
    * Just make it more difficult to get distracted
* Trick 7: Speak to someone
    * Speak to your seniors
    * Speak to a more motivated friend
    * Visit me during office hours
* Trick 8: Stay healthy!
    * Sometimes you feel unmotivated because of your physical condition
    * Get some exercise
    * Cook a healthy meal
    * Go to bed early
    * Stand up and move around
    * Have a coffee (if you're sleepy)
    * Stop drinking coffee (if you're getting stressed)
* Tricks collected from other classes
    * Take a bath
    * Listen to some heavy music
    * Reward yourself with sweets
    * Have a nap.
