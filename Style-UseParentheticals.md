# Style - Use Parentheticals

Give extra information in the MIDDLE of a sentence. For example: 

* Cats are cute.
* Cats (a common pet) are cute


## There are three ways:
* Dashes - 
* Brackets ("parentheses")
* Commas ,,


## Just put one on each side of the extra information
* Cats – a common pet – are cute.
* Cats (a common pet) are cute.
* Cats, a common pet, are cute.

## Remember you need TWO of them!
* ~~Cats — a common pet are cute.~~
* ~~Cats (a common pet are cute.~~
* ~~Cats, a common pet are cute.~~

## Do not use commas if you have commas already
* OK: The three disadvantages - A, B, and C - that this causes are a problem.
* OK: The three disadvantages (A, B, and C) that this causes are a problem.
* NO: ~~The three disadvantages, A, B, and C, that this causes are a problem.~~

## Careful with dashes
* Technically they're not correct
* Read [this](Style-UseDashesCorrectly) (but be warned, most native English speakers don't know or care about this)
