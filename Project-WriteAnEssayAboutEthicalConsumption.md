# Project: Write an Paragraph on Ethical Consumption

## Aim 
We will write an essay about ethical consumption (倫理的消費) (why we need to think carefully about people and the environment before we buy things).

This is the FOUR PARAGRAPH version of this project. 

By the end of this project, you will be able to write an essay summarising your reading on the problem:

* Invention
    * Research a topic
    * take notes
    * cite sources (出典を引用します)
* Arrangement: Put your ideas in a clear order
* Style: Write clear sentences, using formal English in academic style 
* Delivery: Format (フォーマット) an essay well (fonts, spacing, titles etc)

## Class 1 Task A: Think and Understand
* We buy/use a lot of different products every day
    * food every day
    * clothes every month
    * electronics (e.g. phone) every few years
* However, this can be bad for:
    * the people/places where they are collected
    * the people/places where they are produced
    * the people/places where they are recycled
* For example, how often is the answer "I don't know"?
    * Was your shirt made by children?
    * Was your phone made in a safe factory? 
    * Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken?  
    * Were your cosmetics tested on animals?  
    * Is there palm oil in your toothpaste?  
    * Will your phone be recycled properly?

## Class 1 Task B: Read the example essay

* [Example is here](Examples-EthicalConsumptionEssay)
* If we are doing the FOUR paragraph version, ignore paragraph 2. 

## Class 1 Task C: Choose a topic 
* Make a list of products  
    * things you used this week or that you buy regularly
    * things you have at home
    * things you want to buy
* Make a list of the MATERIALS (材料) used in the things on your list
    * e.g. palm oil in toothpaste
    * e.g. cotton in t-shirts
* Choose a good essay topic from your list:
    * Must be a material (材料) or a very simple product
    * Do not choose complicated things (e.g. iPhone)
    * Do not choose my example  topic (shea butter)
* Claim it online
    * TASK: Post on Classroom 
    * Read what your classmates have posted. 
    * If someone else has chosen your topic, too late! Choose a new one! 
    * Post your topic e.g. "I'm Hiroko, and I choose cotton"
* Do some research - is your topic OK? 
    * Research your topic a little. 
        * Read 3 things. Take notes
        * Japanese OK! This is writing practice, not reading practice!
        * Google your topic + "problem" or the example keywords below
            * Find good sources (newspapers, government, NGO). 
            * Avoid bad sources (wikipedia, dictionary, answer sites) 
            * Avoid plagiarisism! (don't copy paste into your notes, it's dangerous)
    * Find 3 problem keywords
        * For people (workers, farmers) and environment NOT for you/companies. 
        * e.g."tobacco farms use child labour" not "tobacco gives us cancer"
        * [Use Keywords](Style-UseKeywords) correctly. Easiest option: use only NOUNS. For example
            * child/slave labour
            * conflict
            * poverty, 
            * dangerous working conditions
            * deforestation
            * air/water/sea/soil pollution
        * If you can't find 3 problems,  change your topic! 
        * In class next week you will share your topic and research. I want to see
            * notes on what you read 
            * 9 lines minimum,  
            * three http links
            * Japanese OK.
