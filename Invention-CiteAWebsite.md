        * Penguins are cute (Suzuki, 2023, April).
        * Penguins are cute (Suzuki, 2023). <- this is most common for Ted Talks
    * If there is no date, use "n.d."
        * Penguins are cute (Suzuki, n.d.)
        * Penguins are cute ("Penguins overview," n.d.)
    * IF there is no human name, use 2-3 words of the article title

* Remember 
    * If there is no name

        * only use the group name if it is an official PDF reports, __as the author__ (UNESCO, 2004)
        * Never ("UNESCO," 2004) - that's an article ABOUT UNESCO, not by UNESCO.
    * Ignore the case of the title as it is printed 
        * ~~HAPPY PENGUIN, Happy Penguin, happypenguin~~
        * all need to be changed to ("Happy penguin," n.d.)
