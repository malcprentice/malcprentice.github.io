# Don't use full names without checking
* When is it OK to use full names? 
    * YES: "However, an article written by Albert Einstein argued that dogs are the best pets"
    * NO: "However, an article written by Hiroko Suzuki argued that dogs are the best pets."
* Why? 
    * Full name means **Famous enough that EVERYONE knows them**
    * Solutions
        * Avoid the problem with bracket style: 
            * "Dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)."
            * According to Suzuki (2019), dogs are the best pets
        * Explain who they are 
            * (but only if the explanation shows that they know the topic)
            * (remember to cite them too) 
            * "However, an article written by Hiroko Suzuki, *Professor of Canine Behaviour at Harvard University,*  argued that dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)"
