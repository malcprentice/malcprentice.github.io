# Quickwrite
(old indexing system version - keep until Fall 2023)

What is a quickwrite (QW)?
Quickwrite = How many words can you write in 10 minutes? 
* QW only: I don't check spelling or grammar!
* Let's practice writing and thinking quickly in English
    * Practice using words you know
    * Practice sharing opinions 
How to do a quickwrite 
1) Choose a topic 
* Choose a topic from [the list](Orientation-QuickwriteTopics)
* Any topic OK. Start easy (at top).
2) Get Ready
* Set a timer for 10 minutes
* Wait! THINK and PLAN for 1 minute first
3) Go!
* Start your 10 minute timer and go! 
* No stopping! No dictionaries! Don’t worry about grammar or spelling!
* Paragraph (段落) - not a list of sentences.
4) After 10 minutes, STOP and count words
* Record your word count at bottom e.g. "(88 words)"
* QW too short?
    * Keep going! 11 minutes! 12 minutes!
    * Record both numbers e.g. "88 words in 10 minutes, 100 words in 12 minutes"
Minimum word count
* Level 3:       75 words in Spring, 125 words in Fall
* Level 2:     100 words in Spring, 150 words in Fall.  
* Level 1:     150 words in Spring, 200 words in Fall  (also electives)
* If you do less, you have NOT done your homework.
Assessment
* I will check at the beginning of term (no points, just checking)
* I will check homework at the Mid Term  (Any missing/short QW = -1 participation)
* I will grade (10%) in WEEK 14 (Still any missing or short?-1 to QW score per problem)
Having problems?
Problems thinking of ideas? 
* Relax! - I'm not checking! 
* Maybe plan for 1 minute more, or do a little reading on the topic. 
* Change the topic a little  ("last movie"  -> "next movie")


In some classes (for exams, or if we are online), we will type.  If typing is the problem 
* Take lessons so you don't get bad habits e.g. http://typingclub.com/ 
* Then play some typing games to get faster e.g. http://phoboslab.org/ztype/
