# Avoid Plagiarism

## Definition and warning
* "Plagiarism" = Stealing someone's words or ideas
* Don't copy paste!  
* Usual reason is doing homework at 3am the day before a 9am deadline. Time management! 
    * If you need an extension, ask for it! 
    * -1 point for late work is better than -100% for copy-paste
* If you copy-paste, I will see it, Google it, and find it. It's easy to spot.
* See university policy for consequences of plagiarism. 
* It can have more serious consequences, especially after first year or during study abroad. Don't become [a famous example of cheating!](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/12/19/the-shameful-final-chapter-for-japans-most-promising-stem-cell-scientist/)


## Types of plagiarism 
### Original sentence (direct quote):
"He renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton" (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Type 1 Plagiarism: Copy-paste with no citation and no quotes
The next year, Einstein **renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America,** where he worked at Princeton.

### Type 2 Plagiarism: Copy-paste with quotes but no citation
The next year Einstein **"renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America"** where he worked at Princeton.

### Type 3 Plagiarism: Copy-paste with citation but no quotes
The next year he **renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America** (Nobel Foundation, 1922) where he worked at Princeton.

### Type 4 Plagiarism: Copy-paste and just change a few words
He gave up **his citizenship for**  some **reasons and emigrated to** the US **to take the position of** teacher   **of Theoretical Physics at Princeton** (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Type 5 Plagiarism: Too many quotes ("Patchwriting")
Deforestation is also a major source of greenhouse gases since **"Approximately a third of all human related greenhouse gas emissions are absorbed by the oceans"**  (SEE Turtles, n.d.). Also, **"WWF works around  the world to establish marine protected areas (MPA) to ensure sea turtles have a safe place to nest, feed and migrate freely"**  (WWF, n.d.), and there is a treaty about the international business of the endangered wild animals and plants. However, **"despite their current protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and many national laws, there is still a disturbingly large amount of illegal trade in hawksbill shells and products"** (WWF, n.d.).

## Solution
* Cite every idea, not once per paragraph.
* Use Google Classroom originality report
    * [Instructions in English](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9335819?hl=en)
    * [Instructions in Japanese](https://support.google.com/edu/classroom/answer/9335819?hl=ja)
    * Type 2 plagiarism is still bad! Turn on "cited or quoted" option! "引用された文を含むテキストをハイライト表示するには、[引用した文章が # 件あります] の横にあるスイッチをオン  にします" 
* No Google Classroom? 
    * [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/plagiarism-checker) can at least give you 
a warning.
    * Some classes might use Turnitin instead. 

## What is the solution?
### Best solution - never copy paste anything, ever!
* Take notes in Japanese, or using only keywords in English
* Write in English sentences in your own words.

### Quoting: OK solution (occasionally) 
* if you really need to quote, do it, but be careful
* Quote ONLY a FEW SHORT and IMPORTANT phrases. Too much = type 5 plagiarism. 
    * Don't forget quotemarks " ", citation, and possibly page number
    * After this, he "renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton" (Nobel Foundation, 1922, p. 23)
* You can make SMALL changes to quotes if they don't change the meaning:
    * Original:  "He doesn’t like cats, and although they are friendly he doesn’t like dogs either"
    * Shorter:    "He doesn’t like cats ... he doesn’t like dogs either"
    * Grammar: "He doesn't like cats ... [or] dogs"
    * Names:  "[Bob] doesn't like cats, ... [or] dogs"
    * Don't change meaning though. 

### BAD solution: Copy-paste-then-Paraphrase
* Please don't. If you copy paste then try to fix it: 
    * You're learning nothing. My feedback on your grammar is wasted. 
    * It's easy to miss a bit and get flagged
    * It's easy to not change it enough and get flagged
* If you have to, change everything! 
    * Change the words. Careful with using a thesaurus - the words are probably wrong
    * Change the word order. Fix the grammar you've just broken. 
    * Change tense in indirect quotes
        * "Imagination **is** more important than knowledge" (Einstein, 1931, p. 31)
        * Einstein (1931) said that imagination **was** more important than knowledge
    * Doing this right is harder than just writing your own summary. Again, try not to!
