## Common mistakes
* Careful of "that" 
    * You can use "said that" or "argued that" or "claimed that" or "found that" 
        * "that" means more or less "って" as in "って言った” 
        * it's for **quoting ideas and facts** 
    * However, some verbs can break easily 
        * they prefer an object that isn't a fact or quote
        * avoid "described that" and try "described an experiment"
        * avoid "outlined that" and try "outlined a plan"
        * avoid "discussed that" and try "discussed the idea"
        * avoid "rejected that" and try "rejected the idea" 
    * Once you've made the verb happy, you can then use "that" to give detail
        *  "described an experiment (that)"
        *  "outlined a plan (that)"
        *  "discussed the idea (that)"
        *  "rejected the idea (that)"
    * Don't use "suggested that" if it's not a suggestion. 
    * Don't use "found that" if it's not a finding (a research result) 
    * If it doubt, use "said"
* Careful of verb tense choice
    * Is it true, relevant, and recent? Maybe use present (says) or perfect (has said). Maybe!
    * Otherwise (and if in doubt) use past ("said")
* Never use 
    * Opinion verbs: guessed, thought
    * Phrasal verbs: came up with, worked out, found out
    * Slang verbs: reckoned, figured
