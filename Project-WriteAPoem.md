## RULES

Poems in English have different rules – can you spot them in this poem by Robert Frost?

	Whose woods these are I think I know.
	His house is in the village, though;
	He will not see me stopping here
	To watch his woods fill up with snow.
	My little horse must think it queer
	To stop without a farmhouse near
	Between the woods and frozen lake
	The darkest evening of the year.
	He gives his harness bells a shake
	To ask if there is some mistake.
	The only other sound's the sweep
	Of easy wind and downy flake.
	The woods are lovely, dark, and deep,
	But I have promises to keep,
	And miles to go before I sleep,
	And miles to go before I sleep.
