<h2 id="Tips">	Tips </h2>
<ul><li>	<red>CAREFUL</red>. You can partition "dogs", but not "Shiba" - start at the right level. </li>
<li>	If your topic has one well-known form (e.g. Gold), normal partition is hard. </li>
<ul><li>	However, you can always find something:  </li>
<ul><li>	conflict Gold and conflict-free Gold </li>
<li>	three main gold-producing areas </li>
</ul></ul><li>	if you want a comment in the same sentence, don't use colons in Option 1/2. They introduce a list, which must finish.  </li>
<ul><li>	Use commas or colons (", of which" " - of which") </li>
<li>	Use a new sentence (". Of these") </li>
</ul><li>	Your teacher might talk about "classification-partition" in the future </li>
<ul><li>	a classification is the first half when you <a href="Style - write a definition sentence.html">write a definition sentence</a>) </li>
<li>	Careful - it's really hard to write both a partition and a definition/classification </li>
<li>	If you want to define AND partition, go UP a level for your definition: "Tigers are a kind of big cat. There are seven kinds of tiger"* </li>
</ul></ul>
