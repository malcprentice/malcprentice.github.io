LOOK HARD, then decide

* Is there a name? 
* Is there a date? 
* What is it? News, magazine, journal, or normal website?
* If news/magazine, can you buy a paper copy anywhere, or is it online only?

## Common Mistakes
* Check the references list format
    * Times New Roman
    * 12 pt
    * Double spaced
    * Burasage
* Italics can be confusing. Follow the examples, but if you are wondering why something is italics, here is the rule:
    * Italics is for the thing you look for when you walk into the library
    * If you can pick it up from a shelf, it gets italics
        * There is a paper version - you hold the whole issue
            * *Mainichi Shimbun*
            * *Japan Times*
            * *The Economist* (magazine)
        * Online ONLY: you print and hold one page
            * BBC News
            * Reuters / AP / AFPBBNews
    * Mainichi Shimbun has a paper version. 
        * You can buy the newspaper.
        * *Mainichi Shimbun* is italics
        * the article is NOT italics
    * BBC News, Reuters: no paper version. 
        * You can only print the article.
        * BBC News / Reuters is NOT italics
        * the *article title is italics*, like a website
