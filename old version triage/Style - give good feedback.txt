###Say something useful
, but       |in the future you could    |avoid touching/waving your notes/// stop dropping your hand ///stand still/straight
Perhaps     |you might try to           |speak louder/slower///make your voice more interesting
However,    |next time maybe            |make more eye contact///stop looking at the ceiling ///look at EVERYONE  	
That said,  |you should probably        |avoid making a fist /// practice pronouncing new words ///practice speaking in phrases
