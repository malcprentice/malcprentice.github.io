Research -  Research Proposal, Ethics Review, and Pilot
Normally, before you are allowed to do research, you have to do
*a proposal
*an ethics review
*a pilot

#Research Diary
Before you begin, start your research diary. INclude
*Any ideas
*Any changes you make
*Any problems you have


#Research Proposal
*A research proposal is like a very short dissertation, without results or discussion
*Include a careful  timetable under “Procedure” - you don’t want to run out of time
*Don’t forget to plan analysis.

##Research Proposal Sections
###Introduction
This dissertation project looks at (general topic)...This topic is important because...The research question(s) is/are...The target audience are teachers/students...+ Tell me how is the answer going to be useful, interesting or new?
###Literature Review
*What have you read? ("According to Smith (1999)...etc")
*What do you plan to read?

###Method
*Participants (See “Choosing Subjects and Sampling” sheet)
**Who will your subjects be (if you have any): age, education level, gender, and any other information
**How/Why will you choose those subjects?
**Materials: What tool will you use?
**Procedure: What will you actually do? Write a week by week schedule.
**Analysis: How will you analyse the data
**Issues: Any other potential problems you can predict and avoid?

#Ethics Review
This is to make sure your research doesn't hurt anyone. You must tell participants that their participation is voluntary and that they have the right to leave and have their data deleted without giving a reason. You need special permission to work with children / the elderly / refugees / the disabled, and if the ethical situation is tricky, you may be asked to get a consent form from each participant.

#Pilot it:
Try it yourself, on some friends, on a few of your subjects, if you can
*Follow your plan with one subject / a small goupr
*Keep writing your Research Diary.
*How did it go?
*Change your plan as needed
*Fix any problems you find
*Next start collecting your data!
