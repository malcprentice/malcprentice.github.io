#Types of evidence
“Is the Loch Ness Monster real or not”
Reason 	|"Loch Ness is very narrow, so where would it hide?"
Report 	|"My cousin said he saw it" (personal report) /// "It was seen by person X on date Y" (testimony)
Research|"The BBC used 600 submarines and found nothing": http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3096839.stm
	
*Reason/Report without Research is weak
**"Loch Ness is very narrow"? yes, but also very deep, so it's easy to hide
**"My cousin said"? OK, but maybe my cousin is lying, or wrong.
*Research without Reason/Report is boring
*A good essay uses Research linked by Reasons. 
*Personal Report is not allowed in academic essays. Cite testimony or it didn't happen.

	
#Example Evidence
###“We should do a study abroad”
1. If we go to Canada, we will have to speak English, so our level will go up.     
2. My friend said that the food she ate on a study abroad was terrible.
3. Study abroad is too expensive - 300000/week (http://www.studyabroad.co.jp)
4. My friend went on a study abroad and made new friends from many countries.
5. When we travel, people we meet learn about Japan and maybe want to visit. More tourists = good economy
6. Other countries are dangerous. According to the LAPD, there were over 1000 murders in 1993 (http://www.laalmanac.com/crime/cr02.html)
	
###For each piece of evidence above, decide
1. Is it Reason, Report or Research? 
2. Is it FOR or AGAINST doing a study abroad?
3. Write a keyword for each piece of evidence.
4. Is it strong? How could you argue against this evidence?
