This paragraph describes three problems that __working part-time while in university__ can cause â€“ lack of sleep, lack of time, and sickness. Firstly, lack of sleep. Due to the late hours, students who work do not get enough rest - this will lead to problems staying awake in class. As a result they get bad grades and their future is at risk. Secondly, since part-time work is often at the weekend, students who work have no spare time. Therefore, are not able to make friends or join clubs. Thirdly, as a result of meeting so many customers, people who work part-time catch many colds. In summary, there are several reasons not to have a part time job.
