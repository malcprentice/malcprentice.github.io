#Overview
+DIscussion
++Topic Sentence 
++Summary
++Implications/Recommendations
++Weaknesses and Future research
++Final COmment

There are some extra sections, but still the same as normal disucssion
Read how to [[Arrangement - write a conclusion paragraph]] first


#Tips
*Use subheadings only if discussion is long.
*In general

2) Links
*Link in a very formally structured research report is probably not necessary. Everyone knows what comes after the Results - it's always the Discussion. So there is no need to say "The next section discusses..."


#Useful language
##Topic Sentence for Discussion
*As with normal essay, this is your thesis statement ( or for experimental research, your research question) in other words.
*Remember to write "This project aimed to discover" or "This experimental report focused on"
**Don't write "essay" by mistake this is not an essay
**Past tense

##Summary
In PRESENT TENSE or PRESENT PERFECT TENSE
No new data or references, unless to help understand what you have already said.
*Focus on summarising your results
**summarize your intro (importance background) in one sentence
**summarize your methods in one sentence
**summarize your results in detail, 
**only summarise your literature to show how it compares with your results
*Conclude: what was the answer to your research question?

##Implications
*What the results mean for readers?
*What should they DO?
*Was anything else interesting?

##Limitations and suggestions for Future research
###Limitations 
*Did anything go wrong?
*WHat does this mean about how safe your conclusions are?
*FOr example:
**"In hindsight, it was unfortunate that
**"This project had some limitations, in that" (e.g. not enough participants, sampling)
**"In addition" (e.g. missing data)

###Future Research
*What should you (or someone) study next?
*e.g. "Future research should aim to determine X")

###Conclusion (maybe optional)
Only if your discussion is really long (4 pages), to tie everything together. 
If it is only one paragraph, you don't need a conclusion section. Maybe a final comment with a prediction
e.g. "If X follow these recommendations, hopefully Y will Z")
