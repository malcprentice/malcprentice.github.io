#Why do a quickwrite?
You need practice writing and thinking quickly in English.
It helps you change English you know (but can't use) into English you can use. Typed quickwrites can also help you do better on typed exams like the iBT TOEFL (a 300 word independent task in 30 minutes needs at least 20 words per minute typing if you want time to think).

However, QW1 in class is by hand. For homework, most classes type.

###1)Get ready
*If handwriting, use B5 loose leaf paper or a notepad. Nothing smaller.
*If typing, download the template from "Shared Materials"
*Choose a topic: [[Resources - quickwrite topics]]
*Put your name, number, class, code (QW1, QW2, etc) and date at the top right of the sheet
*Add the title of your chosen topic in the middle.
*Set your phone timer for 10 minutes

###2)Write!
*Start your timer
*Start writing
*No stopping! No dictionaries!
*Donâ€™t worry about grammar or spelling!
*Do try to follow [[Resources - paragraph basics]] though
*Change the topic if you need to (for example if the topic is "last holiday", you can change it to "holiday in JHS" or "next holiday" if you have no ideas. But stay in basic topic.)

###3)After 10 minutes, STOP and count your words
*Use "Word Count"
*Do not count name/title!
*Later, write your word count on your namecard in class
*If your word count is under the minumum, keep going:
**keep going until you hit the minimum (below)
**Record both numbers:
**e.g. "103 words (88 words in 10 minutes)"

#Minimum Word Count
If you do less than the following, you have NOT done your homework.

Time            		|Typed C/D			|Typed GCP
--------------------	|------------------ |---------
QW 1-10         		|100 words minimum	|100
QW 11-20        		|150 words minimum	|150
QW 21-43        		|200 words minimum	|200
QW 1-10 (Fall)  		|200 words minimum	|200
QW 11-20        		|225 words minimum	|250
QW 21-43        		|250 words minimum	|300




###4) If typed
*Submit your QW online
*I will tell you how to do this in a later class

###5) In class we will:
*Switch and read your partners QW. Discuss
*I will check you met the minimum length
*Under the minimum word count: <red>NG</red> stamp

###)At the end of the course - assessment
*I will check your QW
*Under the minimum for the term: <red>NG</red> stamp
*More than the minimum for the term: <green>OK</green> stamps

#Having problems?
If your QW is too short, or you're taking a long time to hit the minimum, then:
*A) Plan your quickwrite more carefully before you start. Take an extra minute to get your ideas ready
*B) Relax!
**I'm not checking these
**I want quantity not quality.
**Care less about your spelling and grammar - we will work on that in the essay project.
*C) Improve your typing
**Take an online test. Japanese OK. If you are under 200 wpm, your problem is typing skill, not English. If so:
**First take lessons so you don't get bad habits. For example: http://typingclub.com/
**Next, practice for speed by zapping aliens: http://phoboslab.org/ztype/
**Beat my high score at the Alien game (2042) and take a screenshot - I will give you a bonus point!
