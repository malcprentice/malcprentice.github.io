###Example 3 - can you find and name the parts?
>>Many university students in Japan like shopping for clothes and accessories. However, many of these are made of leather from cows - especially bags, wallets, shoes, and jackets. This is a problem, because not all leather is made in an ethical way. As such, this essay first describes leather production in detail, then looks at some problems it causes and some possible solutions to those problems.

###Example 4 - can you find and name the parts?
>>Most people in Japan take for granted that if they get sick, they can go to the hospital and get help. However, this is not always true in the developing world, where access to medicine and doctors can be difficult. This is a problem because if people cannot access medical help, it shortens their life and damages the economy of the country. This essay uses the example of one country - Afghanistan - as a case study to examine this problem, then looks at whether the lessons learned there can be applied elsewhere.

#Example Intro for Quiz
>>According to Edison (1904), success is "1% inspiration and 99% perspiration", but it is not clear where this 99% hard work comes from. One of the places we might find the answer is in the story of the lives of famously successful people. If so, it would be useful because students can learn how they themselves should study. This essay describes the school and then the university experience of Darwin, the naturalist most famous for his work on the theory of evolution.
