# Style - write a Detail Sentence

## WHen I ask for a detail, I mean
* an example
* a fact
* a quotation
* A response (a doubt)
* a clarification
* a reason
* an answer to a basic question (who what where why when which how)

## Remember to mark them clearly 

* e.g. an example   "For instance"
* e.g. an effect   "As such"
* e.g. a cause  "One reason for this is"
* e.g. another point "In addition, "
* e.g. a response "However," or "In fact"

## Remember to follow instructions
* For example, in a "Solutions" paragraph, the details I want are a summary and a response. 
* For example, in a "Description paragraph, I usually ask the second detail sentence have a number and a citation. 

## Careful 
* Don't start a detail sentence with so, or, but, and
    * NO: . So .And .But .Or
    * OK: , so , and , but , or
* JOIN sentences. Don't separate them 
    * NO: I like dogs. And cats
    * OK: I like dogs and cats    
* If you really need to start a new sentence, use the right link
    * And = . Additionally, 
    * But = However
