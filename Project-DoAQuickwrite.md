# Quickwrite

## What is a quickwrite (QW)?

Quickwrite = How many words can you write in 10 minutes? 

* QW only: I don't check spelling or grammar!
* Let's practice writing and thinking quickly in English
    * Practice using words you know
    * Practice sharing opinions 

## How to do a quickwrite 

* Choose a topic 
    * Choose a topic from [the list](Resources-QuickwriteTopics)
    * Any topic OK. Start easy (at top).
* Get Ready
    * Set a timer for 10 minutes
    * Wait! THINK and PLAN for 1 minute first
* Go!
    * Start your 10 minute timer and go! 
    * No stopping! No dictionaries! Don't worry about grammar or spelling!
    * Paragraph (段落) - not a list of sentences.
* After 10 minutes, STOP and count words
    * Record your word count at bottom e.g. "(88 words)"
    * QW too short?
        * Keep going! 11 minutes! 12 minutes!
        * Record both numbers e.g. "88 words in 10 minutes, 100 words in 12 minutes"

## Minimum word count
* Level 3: 75 words 
* Level 2: 100 words 
* Level 1: 150 words  
* After week 3 of term, if you do less, you have NOT done your homework.

## Assessment
* I will check at the beginning of term (no points, just checking)
* I will check homework at the Mid Term  (Any missing/short QW = -1 participation)
* I will grade (10%) in WEEK 14 (Still any missing or short?-1 to QW score per problem)

## Having problems?
* Problems thinking of ideas? 
    * Relax! - I'm not checking! 
    * Maybe plan for 1 minute more, or do a little reading on the topic. 
    * Change the topic a little  ("last movie"  -> "next movie")
* In some classes (for exams, or if we are online), we will type.  If typing is the problem 
    * Take lessons so you don't get bad habits e.g. http://typingclub.com/ 
    * Then play some typing games to get faster e.g. http://phoboslab.org/ztype/
