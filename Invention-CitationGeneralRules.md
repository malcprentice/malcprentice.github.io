# Citation General Rules

* This is for IN TEXT and ON SLIDE *citations*
* For END OF ESSAY or LAST SLIDE *references*, see  the [Reverence General Rules](Invention-ReferenceGeneralRules)

##  Style overview

As a rough guide (it depends on the department / journal), some  styles you might see are:

* [APA](https://apastyle.apa.org)  -  Psychology but also often Linguistics, Journalism, Education, some Engineering
* [MLA](https://www.mla.org/MLA-Style) - Communication, Theater, Philosophy
* [Chicago](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org)  -                History, Art, Music, Economics
* [Bluebook](http://www.legalbluebook.com/)  - US Law
* [AMA](http://healthlinks.washington.edu/hsl/styleguides/ama.html) - Medicine


## Choose the style
### 1) Brackets style

* This is 
    * Easier
    * The ONLY option for titles. 
    * The ONLY option for slides
* It looks like this:
    * (Suzuki, 2021) 
    * (Suzuki, 2021, April)  
    * (Suzuki, n.d.)
    * ("Title," 2021, April) 
    * ("Title," n.d.)
    * For details, see [Cite Brackets Style](Invention-CiteBracketsStyle)

### 2) Sentence style

* This is 
    * More difficult
    * Not usable for titles
    * Not used on slides
* It looks like this: 
    * According to Suzuki (2021)  
    * Suzuki (2021, April 13) says that 
    * Suzuki (n.d.) adds that
    * Research by Suzuki (2021, April) suggests that
    * For details, see [Cite Sentence Style](Invention-CiteSentenceStyle)

## ADVANCED ISSUES
* Direct quotes (" ") from a book need the page number(s)
    * "Something something" (Suzuki, 2002, p.23)
    * "Penguins are great" (Suzuki, 2010, pp. 25-26)
    * Suzuki (2002, p.23) says "something something".
    * According to Suzuki (2013, April 16), "something something is something".
* One fact with more than one citation? Use semicolons
    * (Smith, 2003; Ellis & Jones, 2004)
    * ~~(Smith, 2003)(Ellis & Jones, 2004)~~
* "and"
    * Use "&"  INSIDE brackets. Use "and" OUTSIDE brackets. 
    * English is great (Smith & Suzuki, 2010).
    * Smith and Suzuki (2010) say that English is great.
    * ~~(Smith and Suzuki, 2010).~~
    * ~~Smith & Suzuki (2010) say~~
    * This is for citations. In [Reference](Invention-ReferenceGeneralRules), always use "&"
* Acronyms like "UNESCO" or "SUA"?
    * First time  
        * In brackets (United Nations High Commision for Refugees [UNHCR], 2000)
        * Sentence style: "The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) helps refugees (UNHCR, 2000)
    * After that, just use "The UNHCR" or "(UNHCR, 2000)"
* More than 1 author (APA7)
    * 1 author
        * Chocolate is great (Suzuki, 2010)
        * Suzuki (2010) says that English is great.
    * 2 authors. 
        * Give both. Use "&" inside brackets but "and" outside
        * Chocolate is great (Suzuki & Smith, 2010)
        * According to Suzuki and Smith (2010), cats are great.
    * 3+ authors. 
        * Give only first. Use "et al.". Careful about period and comma. 
        * Chocolate is great (Suzuki et al., 2010)
        * According to Suzuki et al. (2010), cats are great.
        * However, you can add more names to avoid using a/b
            * For example this: 
                * (Suzuki, Yamazaki & Smith, 2010)
                * (Suzuki, Yamazaki & Tanaka, 2010)
            * Is better than this:
                * (Suzuki, et al., 2010a)
                * (Suzuki, et al., 2010b)
* Be careful using full names
    * YES: "However, an article written by Albert Einstein argued that dogs are the best pets"
    * NO: "However, an article written by Hiroko Suzuki argued that dogs are the best pets."
    * Why? 
        * Full name means __Famous enough that EVERYONE knows them__
        * Solutions
            * Avoid the problem with bracket style: 
                * "Dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)."
                * According to Suzuki (2019), dogs are the best pets
            * Explain who they are and why reader should care about their opinion   
                * (remember to cite them too) 
                * "However, an article written by Hiroko Suzuki, *Professor of Canine Behaviour at Harvard University,*  argued that dogs are the best pets (Suzuki, 2019)"
## Answer not here?
