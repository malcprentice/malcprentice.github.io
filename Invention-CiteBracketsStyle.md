## Basics of Brackets style

|Type                |Content                |Example
|---                 |---                    |---

|A TED Talk          |name, year, month      |(Suzuki, 2015, April)
|No date?            |use n.d.               |(Suzuki, n.d.)
|No author?          |use the title          |("Title," 2015)
|No title or date?   |use title+n.d.         |("Title," n.d.)
|No author, Japanese title?     |use romaji  |("Romaji no daimei," 2015)
|No author or date?  |Title + n.d.           |("Title," n.d.)
|2 authors?          |use "&"                |(Suzuki & Jones, 2015)
|3+ authors?         |use "et al.,"          |(Suzuki et al., 2015)
|2+ sources          |use semicolon (;)      |(Tanaka, 2003; Suzuki, 2015)
|same name/year      |a b                    |(Suzuki, 2015a) ... (Suzuki, 2015b).
|Same no date?       |-a, -b                 |(Suzuki, n.d.-a) ... (Suzuki, n.d.-b).
|"Direct quote"?     |use page number        |"I have a dream" (King, 2015, p.23)


## Common mistakes
* Check spaces and commas and periods carefully!
* Family name, no initials
    * OK: (Suzuki, 2012) 
    * NO: ~~(Hiroki, S., 2012) ~~   
    * NO: ~~(Suzuki, Hiroki, 2012)~~
* Give the right amount of date. 
    * Books are year only
    * Newspapers are year, month day. 
    * Others vary. Check the examples
* Title problems
    * Comma inside quotes
        * ("Title," n.d.)
        * ("Title", n.d.)
* Shorten long titles 
    * 1 word is enough. 
    * 6 words max. 3 words max if long words. 
    * Use your judgement - is it making the sentence hard to read?
    * This is too long ("The impact of global warming on river dolphins in the Amazon," n.d.)
    * This is better ("The impact," n.d.) 


# Citation Verb Alternatives

Bored of "said"?

## Choose based on your field (Brexina, 2012)
* Arts Writers 
    * Most common: pointed out, noted, argued, suggested, stated, observed, explained
    * Also used: claimed, said, remarked, maintained, showed, proposed, stressed, mentioned
* Science Writers 
    * use fewer verbs more often:
    * Most common: pointed out, showed
    * Also used: argued, emphasized, observed, discussed

## Choose based on confidence
* "The author is sure, and I believe them":
    * said, mentioned, observed             
    * concluded, wrote
    * reported, emphasized, pointed 
    * out, stressed, noted
    * illustrated, established         
    * described, showed, confirmed
    * stated, indicated           
    * demonstrated, found       
* "The author is unsure, or I'm not sure about the author":
    * assumed, believed, suggested, maintained, claimed
    * argued, reasoned, speculated, implied, posited
    * proposed, hypothesized, postulated, contended       
    * indicated, estimated, asserted   

## These verbs have more specific meaning:

    * Questions: asked, wondered, questioned whether
    * Suggestions: suggested, advised, proposed, recommended

    * Admit Problems: admitted, acknowledged
* These verbs say what the author did
    * highlighted the fact that
    * made the case that  
    * presented evidence that 


## Common mistakes
* Careful of "that" 
    * You can use "said that" or "argued that" or "claimed that" or "found that" 
        * "that" means more or less "って" as in "って言った” 
        * it's for **quoting ideas and facts** 
    * However, some verbs can break easily 
        * they prefer an object that isn't a fact or quote
        * avoid "described that" and try "described an experiment"
        * avoid "outlined that" and try "outlined a plan"
        * avoid "discussed that" and try "discussed the idea"
        * avoid "rejected that" and try "rejected the idea" 
    * Once you've made the verb happy, you can then use "that" to give detail
        *  "described an experiment (that)"
        *  "outlined a plan (that)"
        *  "discussed the idea (that)"
        *  "rejected the idea (that)"
    * Don't use "suggested that" if it's not a suggestion. 
    * Don't use "found that" if it's not a finding (a research result) 
    * If it doubt, use "said"
* Careful of verb tense choice
    * Is it true, relevant, and recent? Maybe use present (says) or perfect (has said). Maybe!
    * Otherwise (and if in doubt) use past ("said")
* Never use 
    * Opinion verbs: guessed, thought
    * Phrasal verbs: came up with, worked out, found out
    * Slang verbs: reckoned, figured
