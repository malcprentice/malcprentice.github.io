## Common mistakes
* Check spaces and commas and periods carefully!

* Family name, no initials
    * OK: (Suzuki, 2012) 
    * NO: ~~(Hiroki, S., 2012) ~~   
    * NO: ~~(Suzuki, Hiroki, 2012)~~
* Give the right amount of date. 
    * Books are year only
    * Newspapers are year, month day. 
    * Others vary. Check the examples
* Title problems
    * Comma inside quotes
        * ("Title," n.d.)
        * ("Title", n.d.)
* Shorten long titles 
    * 1 word is enough. 
    * 6 words max. 3 words max if long words. 
    * Use your judgement - is it making the sentence hard to read?
    * This is too long ("The impact of global warming on river dolphins in the Amazon," n.d.)
    * This is better ("The impact," n.d.)
