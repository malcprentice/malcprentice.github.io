# Check for Bias  
Sometimes it is obvious that a source is not good. Sometimes it is not. 


# Bias and Quality practice task
* What is Bias? 
    * e.g. research funded by a company making money from the thing researched
    * e.g. research done by a researcher making money from the thing researched.
    * e.g. a journal that only publishes papers which say climate change doesn't exist


## Here are five sources (journal, newspaper) 
* Look at the [Wikipedia article on fair trade](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_trade_debate)
* Choose some random articles from the bottom. 
* Grade them as follows:

|Bias                        |Quality
|-----                       |---
|Unbiased  = 5               |High Quality   = A
|Maybe a bit biased = 3      |Medium Quality     = B
|Totally Biased  = 1         |Low Quality    = C


# Satire and April Fools: getting "onioned"
When you do not read critically enough, sometimes you even believe things that are written to be funny.

* For example, some people shared this article with their friends thinking it was real: http://www.theonion.com/article/emergency-crews-attempt-to-rescue-olympic-figure-s-35313
* Even real newspaper sometimes unthinkingly reprint articles that were meant as jokes:
    * Example 1: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8237558.stm
    * Example 2: http://www.npr.org/2012/12/01/166293306/the-onion-so-funny-it-makes-us-cry
* Your turn. Of these articles, some are jokes and some are real. Can you tell the difference? How?

## Solution: Checking the source
Some sources are usually reliable. Some are usually not.

* Is it a joke site?
* Is it a type of source known for being unreliable (e.g. a tabloid newspaper)
* Is it likely to be very biased?

However, even reliable sources sometimes print things that are not true (either deliberately on April Fools, or by accident), so...

## Solution: Triangulate
* Check AT LEAST TWO other DIFFERENT sources, to see if it is also reported there.
    * If it is about a country, read the papers from other countries
    * If it is political, read papers biased to more than one side
    * If it is a new science article, check for replication or similar research. Many new findings are not reliable until the experiment has been repeated a few times. Wait, or report carefully
