# Orientation - Class Rules

* 1) Even if you are absent, homework missing = minus point
    * Of course if you have a good excuse, tell me = no minus point
    * However, a good excuse = why you couldn't do it __at any time in previous week__
    * Do homework early. 
        * For example, if your HW is due Friday, don't wait untilFriday morning 
        * Do it Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
    * Maybe do 2-3 weeks of HW in advance. 
* 2) You don't need to email me if you're going to be absent.
