# Style - Understand Tag Questions

## Matching practice
THese aren't difficult, but you need to learn to recognise them fast, as the TOEIC / conversation will expect an answer soon after you hear the tag.

## TOEIC tricks
These are all CHECK questions, and the TOEIC usually tricks you by making the question not yes or no, but some other answer to "deshou?" Expect something like 

* I'm not sure, but I'll ask the customer.
* Maybe/Perhaps/Possibly but let's call and see
* I think so
* Probably, but I'll check to make sure.
* I don't know, sorry.
* I hope so, it's important.
* Sorry, it didn't. I'll make sure it arrives tomorrow. 
* Definitely, I called him to check.
