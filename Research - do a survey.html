        	<p>	For your class project, I recommend an Interview. </p>
	<p>	A "survey" basically means an Interviews or a Questionnaire </p>
	<p>	This page is about shared issues, and how to choose between them.  </p>
	<p>	For specific tips see: </p>
<ul><li>	<a href="Research - do an interview.html">do an interview</a> </li>
<li>	<a href="Research - make a questionnaire.html">make a questionnaire</a> </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>

<h3>	<p>	Interviews  							Questionnaires </p>
</h3>	<p>	
<table border="1">  <tr><td>You can only do 1-2 interviews a day  	</td><td>You can send 10000</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Need to do it in person 				</td><td>Can email or post</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Cannot be anonymous. 					</td><td>Can be anonymous</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Not good for embarrassing questions 	</td><td>A little better for embarrassing questions</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Everyone will probably finish 			</td><td>Many questionnaires will go in bin</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Flexible - you can add questions 		</td><td>Fixed - once you send it you can’t change</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Hard to analyse (transcribe, code)  	</td><td>Easier to analyse (especially if closed)</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Interviewer can change (bias) questions </td><td>Questions always the same (reliable)</td></tr> </p>
	<p>	<tr><td>Can see body language, expressions   	</td><td>No body language, etc.</td></tr> </p>

<h4>	My recommendation </h4>
	<p>	Interviews are best for finding out what a few people think/do when you are not sure.  </p>
	<p>	Questionnaires are best for checking something is true with a large number of people </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	This means interviews are better than questionnaires for undergraduate projects because usually: </p>
<ul><li>	You will have a small number of subjects </li>
<li>	You don't know exactly what you are looking for ... </li>
<li>	...so it is hard to write good questionnaire questions </li>
<li>	You can change interviews as you learn - you don't have to perfect first time </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id="Writing good survey questions">	Writing good survey questions </h2>
<h4>	Why are these bad questions? </h4>
<ol><li>	Do you enjoy dyadic interaction in your ESP class?      </li>
<li>	In which ways have you and which ways have you not changed the way you teach based on your experience as a learner and as someone who lives in a foreign country? </li>
<li>	What would be the best way to learn Japanese for a Canadian student? </li>
<li>	What wouldn’t you avoid doing if you were not in Japan? </li>
<li>	How much do you weigh? </li>
<li>	How much homework do you do every night? </li>
<li>	When did you stop stealing bicycles?                                                </li>
<li>	Do you agree that punishing students, when done by a good teacher, is a good thing? </li>
<li>	How much time do you spend on the internet: 5-10 hours per week, 2-5 hours per week, 0-2 hours per week </li>

</ol>
</ol>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	Principles of Question Writing </h4>
	<p>	Can you match any of the above questions to the problems below? </p>
<ul><li>	Don't use words your participant doesn't know. </li>
<li>	Avoid double questions </li>
<li>	Don't ask participants to guess what other people might think </li>
<li>	Don't ask participants about topics they don't know </li>
<li>	No double negatives </li>
<li>	Be careful with embarassing questions </li>
<li>	Be careful with questions where participant might want to impress or give "right" answer </li>
<ul><li>	“How many books have you read?” </li>
<li>	“How many have you had time to read?”    </li>
</ul><li>	Be careful with multiple choice - they need to cover everything and not overlap </li>
<li>	Avoid loaded questions (questions with no escape - a "bang" in both ends) </li>
<li>	Avoid leading questions (questions that show what answer you want) </li>
<li>	Add check questions “How many books did you read last week?” </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	Types of questions </h4>
<ul><li>	OPEN questions </li>
<ul><li>	(When you don’t know what people do or how they will answer) </li>
<li>	e.g. What is your favourite band? </li>
</ul><li>	CLOSED questions </li>
<ul><li>	(when it is yes/no, or a small range of choice) </li>
<li>	e.g. Do you prefer salmon or tuna? </li>
<li>	How many/how often/where/when + abcd choice </li>

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
