# Invention - Find Good Sources 

When you are looking for sources, try this:

## 1) Find the keywords
* Read the Japanese Wikipedia page
* Google the topic in Japanese
* Translate the main idea keywords into English.
* Read the English Wikipedia page to find the keywords in English
* Make a list

## 2) Search for those keywords
For example, in animals essay, use the country-keyword combination

* e.g. Bengal Tiger hunting 
* e.g. Galapagos penguin global warming
* e.g. plastic bags sea pollution
* e.g. Syrian Refugee destruction of hospitals

### Search options
* Various Googles
    * Google English: https://google.com
    * Google Japanese: https://google.co.jp
    * Google News: http://news.google.com
* Remember you can
    * Limit it to governmental sites ("site:gov" or "site:.gov.jp")
    * Limit it to university sites ("site:ac.jp" or "site:ac.jp")
    * Limit it to recent articles using Search Tools
    * Limit it to exact matches with quotes "". See the difference this makes:
        * amazon "ngo japan"
        * "amazon ngo" japan
* If you find something good, follow the links it uses, maybe you can use them too. 

## 3) Trim and save 
* You probably found too much. Skim quickly and drop anything not useful.
* Save the PDF (or PRINT the web page as PDF)
    * It's easier to take notes on a PDF
    * If the original article is moved,you still have it

    * Any other kind of "pedia", including normal Encyclopaedias.
* Any "question answering" site, including:
    * Quora answers
    * Yahoo answers
    * About.com
* MOst of your sites should be 
    * High Quality News Sites
    * NGO reports
    * Government reports
    * High quality personal websites by experts
    * Academic articles you have read (maybe in Japanese) on your courses
    * Books (maybe later, for your dissertation)
