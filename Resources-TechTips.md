## Google Drive - Too many notifications

## Googe Drive - Can't access file
* Do your friend not have access? Then it's my fault- email me.
* Do your friends have access? So do you then.
    * Do not "request access"
    * You're probably not logged in to the right account
    * Log in to your university account 

## Google Drive Spellcheck not working

* Don't forget to turn on the citation switch. 
    * [引用した文章が <数値> 件あります] の横にあるスイッチをオン にします
    * Don't just check flagged "フラグ済みの文". You must ALSO click 詳細, then if you see it [引用した文章が <数値> 件あります] の横にあるスイッチをオン にします
* The instructions might say "適切に引用した文が含まれているテキスト" 
    * but using "適切" is tricky. It's OK to use it 
        * ONLY IN QUOTES " " 
        * ONLY ONCE per paragraph  
        * ONLY IF the actual words are important. 
    * For example
        * OK: King said that he had a dream (King, 1963). 
        * OK, occasionally: "I have a dream," (King, 1963)
        * NOT OK, ever, anywhere: I have a dream (King, 1963)
