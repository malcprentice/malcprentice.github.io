# Project - Do a Quick Code

## Aim
This activity helps you practice:

* understanding coding tasks in English
* solving problems
* describing problems to others
* searching for solutions on the internet in English (e.g. at Stack Exchange: http://stackexchange.com/)
* asking for help
* giving advice
* understanding advice given by others
* prepare for coding interviews if you are going into that field 


## Instructions
* 1) Sign up for an HackerRank account: https://www.hackerrank.com
* 2) Choose your "domain"
    * Beginner: Click Python and learn the basics
    * Intermediate: Choose Algorithms and try to use what you already know in the language you prefer
    * Advanced: Click "Competition" and try the Euler problems
* 3) Choose and solve some problems.
* 4) If you can't do it
    * Google the topic ("How to use a C++ dictionary")
    * Ask a friend
    * Read the discussions
* 5) Choose one interesting problem. How did it go? Make a sentence for your log
    * I could solve this problem, but the solution in the discussion was better because...
    * I could solve this problem, but I learned something new to do it, which was...
    * I could solve this problem. I realised....
    * I could solve this problem. I ...
    * I couldn't solve this problem, because I couldn't understand the question. I'm going to ...
    * I couldn't solve this problem. The error kept saying "" and I couldn't find the answer. I'm going to ...
* 6) Print or save the problem to show in class
* 7) In class, SHOW me your printout/sentence, then SHARE what happened with your partner
* describe your problem
* describe what you did
* share your reflection on the problem
