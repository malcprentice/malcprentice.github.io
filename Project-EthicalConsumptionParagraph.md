# Project: Write an Paragraph on Ethical Consumption

## Aim 
We will write an essay about ethical consumption (倫理的消費) (why we need to think carefully about people and the environment before we buy things).

By the end of this project, you will be able to write a problem-solution paragraph:
* Invention
    * Research a topic
    * take notes
    * cite sources (出典を引用します)
* Arrangement: Put your ideas in a clear order
* Style: Write clear sentences, using formal English in academic style 
* Delivery: Format (フォーマット) an essay well (fonts, spacing, titles etc)

## Essay Project Step 1 (In Class): Introduction 

### 1A: Think and Understand
* We buy/use a lot of different products every day
    * food every day
    * clothes every month
    * electronics (e.g. phone) every few years
* However, this can be bad for:
    * the people/places where they are collected
    * the people/places where they are produced
    * the people/places where they are recycled
* For example, how often is the answer "I don't know"?
    * Was your shirt made by children?
    * Was your phone made in a safe factory? 
    * Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken?  
    * Were your cosmetics tested on animals?  
    * Is there palm oil in your toothpaste?  
    * Will your phone be recycled properly?

### 1B:  Watch a video
* Watch this: video [Trainers/Sneakers (5 mins)](https://www.ted.com/talks/angel_chang_the_wildly_complex_anatomy_of_a_sneaker?language=en)
* Turn on subtitles (字幕)  
* Take notes.

### 1C: Read this example paragraph 
* This is adapted from the 5 paragraph APA version: example ethical consumption essay 
* Bold bits can and should be copied
* Bold underline italics bits should be changed to match ideas
* See how keywords are used in beginning, middle, and end. poverty, lack of child education, and loss of trees.
* See how the main topic (shea butter) isn't repeated too often. 

> Every day in Japan, people use personal care products like soap, moisturiser, and creams. One important ingredient in many of these products is shea butter, which is made from a nut grown in West Africa. However, not all shea butter is produced in an ethical way. This paragraph outlines three problems that shea butter production can cause - poverty, lack of child education, and loss of trees. The first problem is poverty. Developed countries buy shea butter at too low a cost for farmers to have a stable income. For this reason, people sometimes make enough money, but sometimes experience poverty. The second problem is lack of child education. Due to a the lack of money, children sometimes have to work making shea butter rather than go to school. As a result, many of them cannot read or write, as situation which can lead to problems arranging export, negotiating, and getting information ("Burkina Faso," n.d.). The third problem is loss of trees. Some people cut down the shea trees in order to make charcoal, which is sold as a commodity, and people can get income quickly ("Charity – shea dream," 2012). However, the trees take a very long time to grow again, and until then people cannot make the butter ("Charity – shea dream," 2012). In summary, there are three main problems - poverty, lack of child education, and loss of trees - of which the most serious is lack of child education. One action that university students wanting to help could take is to donate to a group working with shea butter makers, such as the NGO Intiraymi, or write a letter to their favourite cosmetics shop asking for them to stock Fair Trade shea butter goods.


## Essay Project Step 2 (Homework): Do a little research, choose a topic
In this unit we will review Unit 1 and start researching your topic. 

* 2A) Make a list of products  
    * things you used this week or that you buy regularly
    * things you have at home
    * things you want to buy
* 2B) Make a list of the MATERIALS (材料) used in the things on your list
    * e.g. palm oil in toothpaste
    * e.g. tantalum in iPhones
    * e.g. cotton in t-shirts
* 2C) Choose a good essay topic from 2B and
* Must be a material (材料) or a very simple product
    * Do not choose complicated things (e.g. iPhone)
    * Do not choose my example essay topic (shea butter)
    * Do not choose the video topic (sneakers)
    * Do not choose endangered animal products like tuna (that's a different essay)
* 2D) Claim it online
    * TASK: Post on Classroom 
    * Read what your classmates have posted. 
    * If someone else has chosen your topic, too late! Choose a new one! 
    * Post your topic e.g. "I'm Hiroko, and I choose cotton"
* 2E) Do some research - is your topic OK? 
    * Research your topic a little. 
        * Read 3 things. Take notes
        * Japanese OK!
        * Google your topic + "problem" or the example keywords below
            * Find good sources []() (newspapers, government, NGO). 
            * Avoid bad sources []() (wikipedia, dictionary, answer sites) 
            * Avoid plagiarisism! []()(don't copy paste into your notes, it's dangerous)
        * Find 3 problem keywords
            * For people (workers, farmers) and environment NOT for you/companies. 
            * e.g."tobacco farms use child labour" not "tobacco gives us cancer"
            * Use Keywords []() correctly. Easiest option: use only NOUNS. For example
                * child/slave labour
                * conflict
                * poverty, 
                * dangerous working conditions
                * deforestation
                * air/water/sea/soil pollution
            * If you can't find 3 problems,  change your topic! 
            * In class next week you will share your topic and research. I want to see
                * notes on what you read 
                * three links
                * Japanese OK. 


# Project Step 3 (In Class): Share your Ideas 

Share your ideas in class. Only do (3) if your topic word is not well known

* My name is Hiroko
* I chose Tantalum. 
* Tantalum is a kind of metal used to make electronics like mobile phones. 
* There are three main problems - child soldiers, dangerous mines, and pollution.  
* details on problems
* Any questions?


# Project Step 4: 

* Problems 
    * child soldiers 
        * Some detail on child soldiers
        * Another detail on child soldiers
    * dangerous mining conditions
        * Some detail on mining conditions
        * Another detail on mining conditions
    * water pollution
        * Some detail on water pollution
        * Another detail on water pollution

You need to add an intro and a conclusion. Don't worry! These are easier to write.

* Introduction sentences 
    * General Background (We buy things)
    * Specific Background (One of those is TOPIC)
    * Thesis statement (This paragraph looks at some problems that X (production) causes
* Problems (see above)
* Conclusion sentences 
    * Summary ("In summary"
    * Final Comment (so what should we do about it?)
