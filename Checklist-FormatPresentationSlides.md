# Checklist - Format Presentation Slides. 

## Short version
* Use the template I give you
* Copy the example carefully
* Do your best, but don't worry. I'll give feedback in class.
    * You will have time to fix problems before submitting. 
    * Remember and avoid the same mistakes next time.

## Long version
* Check the Title slide
    * Is there a Title in [Title Case?](Style-UseTitleCase)
    * Is there Name, class and number?
* Check the Outline slide
    * Copy your main titles. Usually 3 keyword lines:
        * 1 line per body slide (for short/1-person presentations)
        * 1 line per section (for long/group presentations)
    * A decoration image 
* Check the Body Slides Format
    * Capitals are consistent. I recommend
        * Title is in [Title Case](Style-UseTitleCase)
        * Text is NOT in title case
    * Every slide needs an image. 
        * Either for Decoration or Meaning (Figure)
            * Decoration: Anything relevant. No penguins!
            * Meaning: Map, graph, etc. 
    * Font: Size, colour, position have meaning. Be consistent (同質)
        * e.g. Points = all 24 pt grey Arial top centre
        * e.g. Title = all 36 pt white Arial middle left
        * e.g. Cite = all 14pt grey Arial bottom right
        * Remove words to fit on line, don't shrink font 
    * Font: Check colours
        * White text on light colour is hard to read
        * Black text on dark colour is hard to read
* Check the Body slides APA
    * Every slide needs APA in this kind of presentation. 
    * If you have 2 sources for one slide
        * Option 1: Format carefully (citation just under fact, small font)
        * Option 2: Both at bottom. Use semicolon ("Title," n.d.; Suzuki, 2019). 
* Check Body slides Content
    * If you will say it, don't write it 
    * Keywords, never sentences
    * Bullet points, never sentences
        * 2-3 bullet points and an image
        * Bullets are LISTS
            * At least 2 points at each level. 
                * First thing
                * Second thing
            * One thing per level is not a list 
                * Don't
                    * Ever 
                        * Do
                            * It 
                                * Like 
                                    * This
* Check Body slides order 
    * For and Against
    * REASON/TIME/STEP 1, 2, 3
    * Description-Problem-Solution
    * Before and After
    * Not ~~For1 Against1 For2 For 3 Against 2 Against 3~~
    * Not ~~1920, 1990, 1880~~
* Check Summary slide
    * ONE SHORT keyword line for each point
    * KEYWORDS not sentences. 
    * Don't forget image
    * Don't need APA, usually
* Check References slide
    * Do normal Invention checklist
    * Most common mistakes for slides:
        * In alphabetical order
        * Burasage is not consistent
            * Do or don't do it. 
            * Don't mix. 
            * Powerpoint/Slides doesn't do burasage - you'll have to copy it to Docs to fix it. 
        * Only list FACTS/IDEAS you used on slides
            * Not decoration images. 
            * Those go on image sources slide 
* Check Image sources slide
    * Is the image decoration or fact/idea?
    * If it was decoration, list its http address here. 
        * No APA in references list. 
        * No citation on slide
    * If it was fact (e.g. map, chart) 
        * APA here
        * APA in references slide
* Question slide
    * No obvious questions ("Have you been to Antarctica")
    * No quiz Questions ("How many penguins live in Antarctica")
    * Different discussions ("Do you like penguins? What do you think about penguins? Would you be a penguin?")
    * No questions that need research ("How can we save the Galapagos penguin from disease?"
