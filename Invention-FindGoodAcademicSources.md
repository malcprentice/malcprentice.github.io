# Find Good Academic Sources

* Some questions to ask:
    * Is anyone citing it? (Google Scholar has a count. Take into account age.)
    * Is it recent enough (philosophy and engineering articles age at different speeds)
    * How good is the source? 
* Access and paywalls
    * You might need to be AT UNIVERSITY (or use a VPN) for some things
    * Check Google Scholar "all versions"
    * To get books
        * Check your own library OPAC 
        * Download a sample chapter from Google Books or Amazon Kindle
        * Find copies in nearby libraries: http://ci.nii.ac.jp/books/
* Google Scholar is main search engine for journal articles
    * http://scholar.google.com 
    * To find more articles, check "cited by" (e.g. " 引用元") or related article (関連記事)
    * To check quality, check citation count: "引用元 6893", not "引用元 1"
* Academic alternatives to Google
    * Eric (academic) http://www.eric.ed.gov/
    * Ethos (British Dissertations) http://ethos.bl.uk/
    * ARDR (Japanese dissertations) https://dbr.nii.ac.jp     
    * Reading lists prepared by experts e.g. http://www.readinglists.manchester.ac.uk/index.html
    * Browse top journals on your topic: http://www.journalindicators.com/indicators
* Quality articles/books are usually published by:
    * Large university publishers like www.cambridge.org
    * Large academic organisations like www.apa.org
    * Large open-source projects like www.plosone.org/
    * Large academic publishing companies: Ingenta/Sciencedirect, Degruyter, Ingenta, Wiley
    * High impact factor journals e.g. www.journalindicators.com/indicators
* Bad sources are more likely to be on
    * Self published books http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/Pay-to-publish 
    * Individual websites, blogs
    * Single topic conspiracy groups: creation dot com, inconvenient history dot com (links spelled out because I don't want to link to them)
    * However, it depends. Some small groups are good, some big ones are bad, some researchers have good quality blogs to share their research. 
    * Learn the names of quality sources for your area.
