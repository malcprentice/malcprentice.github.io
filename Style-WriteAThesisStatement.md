Style-WriteAThesisStatement

## What is a thesis statement (TS)?
* A thesis statement gives the _topic,_ and the _main idea_ of your essay, or section. It's like a topic sentence, but while the topic sentence STARTS a PARAGRAPH, a thesis statement usually ENDS an INTRO and says what you will be reading for the rest of the text.
