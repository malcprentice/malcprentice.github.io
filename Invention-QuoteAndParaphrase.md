# Quote and Paraphrase

If you need to use someone else's words, there are two options: Quote or Paraphrase.
 
## Option 1: Quote
* "Quote" = Use the writer’s EXACT words in quotemarks ("")
* After this, he __"__renounced his citizenship for political reasons and emigrated to America to take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton__"__ (Nobel Foundation, 1922)
* Only do this for a FEW important quotes.
* Usually, you should paraphrase. ALWAYS give a page number if you can

* You can make SMALL changes to quotes:
    * Original: "He doesn’t like cats, and although they are friendly he doesn’t like dogs either"
    * Shorter: "He doesn’t like cats ... he doesn’t like dogs either"
    * Fix grammar: "He doesn't like cats ... [or] dogs"
    * Fix pronouns: "[Bob] doesn't like cats, ... [or] dogs"
 
## Option 2: Paraphrase - use your own words and grammar


* The best way to avoid having to paraphrase is 
    * take notes in Japanese (only keywords in English) \
    * write in English. 
    * That way it's your own words
* If you do copy-paste-change paraphrase, it's easy to break grammar or accidentally plagiarise. Remember to:
    * Change the words. Be careful of thesaurus, they often give a wrong word: http://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/
    * AND change the word order
    * AND then fix the grammar for your new version
    * Sometimes you need to change tense if you remove quotes
        * "Imagination is more important than knowledge" (Einstein, 1931, p. 31)
        * Einstein (1931) said _that_ imagination _was_ more important than knowledge


##Example paraphrases - why are these bad/good?
### Original
>__He renounced his citizenship__ __for political reasons__ and __emigrated to America__ to __take the position of Professor of Theoretical Physics at Princeton__ (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Bad paraphrase 1 - word/idea _order_ different, words not changed
>__For political reasons__, he __renounced his citizenship__ and __ took the position of Theoretical Physics Professor at Princeton__ after he __emigrated to America__ (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Bad paraphrase 2 - words changed but order the same
>Einstein __gave up his nationality__ for political __motives__ and __moved to the US__ to __occupy the post of Lecturer on__ Theoretical Physics in Princeton (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Bad paraphrase 3 - meaning has been changed
>__Einstein hated politicians, so he settled in the Americas and became a Prince__ (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Good paraphrase - words/idea order/grammar changed
>On political grounds, Einstein gave up his citizenship, and having settled in the US became a Professor at Princeton University, teaching Theoretical Physics (Nobel Foundation, 1922).

### Good summary (paraphrase and shorten without changing meaning). 
>Einstein went to work at Princeton, having first given up his citizenship (Nobel Foundation, 1922).
