## To students
My email is in the manual and on your syllabus. 

* Lost it? <a href="mailto:notmyrealaddressjustaspamfilter@alba-english.com">Use this backup address</a> 
* Before you email, review how to write a well formatted email in [Orientation-AskForHelp.md](Orientation-AskForHelp)
* For questions, you could just come see me instead - check my schedule (in manual, and on my door) then book an office hour appointment. 

## For Teachers
