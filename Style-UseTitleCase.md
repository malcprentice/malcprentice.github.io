Title case is when you give the important words in a title a capital letter (大文字)

## Example of cases

* THIS SENTENCE IS ALL IN UPPER CASE (大文字)

## What are the rules?

* (大文字) = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs, and Long Words (>4 letters)
* (小文字) = and, or, not, but, a, an, the, as, at, by, for, in, of, on, to, if, do, will, do be, can, had etc.


## Important! "No title case" doesn't mean " all lower case"
