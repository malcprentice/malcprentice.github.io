# Use title case 
Title case is when you give the important words in a title a capital letter (大文字)

## Example of cases
* this text is all in lower case
* THIS TEXT IS ALL IN UPPER CASE
* This Text is in Title Case

# What are the rules?

Capitalize important words:

* (大文字) = Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives, Adverbs, and Long Words (>4 letters)
* (小文字) = and, or, not, but, a, an, the, as, at, by, for, in, of, on, to, if, do, will, do be, can, had etc.

## When do I use Title Case?

* The title of your essay (ABC)
* The title of your RR homework
* Subtitles in an essay
* In the references section 
    * This is complicated
    * See [Invention - References General Rules](Invention-ReferencesGeneralRules)
    * But basically, only for Magazine, Newspaper, Website names (i.e. CONTAINERS of articles. Not for normal books or for article titles. 
    

## If I say "No title case"

(e.g. from references article titles)

You still keep normal capital rules:

* Names, cities don't change
    * e.g. Harry Potter and the philosopher’s stone
    * e.g. The impact of climate change on London
* First letter is **still**  capital letters
* First letter after a colon: **Also** a capital
* Acronyms (TOEIC, CIA) don't change
