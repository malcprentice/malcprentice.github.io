# Write a Resume(CV) and Cover Letter

## Warmer Discussion
* Are you doing job hunting (part time or full time)?  
* What part time jobs have you had?
* What job do you want after you graduate?
* Are you interested in English-speaking jobs or jobs overseas? 
* Where do students look for jobs these days?

## C.V. or Resume? Which is which?
* Resume: A one page summary. Work first. More for US and business
* CV: A 2-3 page summary. School first. More for UK and academics.


# Step 1 - Analyse a CV/Resume structure

Look at the examples
* How are they different?
* What are the sections in each?
* What order is each section in? 
* How much information is given
* How are each different from Japanese rirekishou?

## Step 2 - write your own
### If you have no work experience, try these:
* Club/circle/team membership
* Volunteer experience
* Driving license
* Awards (study, sports)
* Sports , Music, Hobbies
* First Aid experience
* What else can you think of?
* WHat words can you use to describe your other experience better? (keen, proficient, qualified, active)

### If you have part-time experience

Make your job sound better (without lying)

__Instead of:__ Waiter, XYZ Ramen, Shinjuku. I took money, took orders, cleaned toilet.
__Better to say:__ Serving staff, XYZ Ramen, Shinjuku. Responsible for cash handling, customer service and hygiene inspection.

|I...                   |I was responsible for...
|-------------          |------------
|took money             |cash handling
|talked to customers    |customer service
|wrote signs            |publicity
|locked the door        |security
|fixed the door         |maintenance
|cooked                 |food preparation
|cleaned (the kitchen)  |(food) hygiene
|put up Halloween decorations |  décor
|told new staff what to do |   staff training
|organised shift swaps  |   scheduling
|did some paperwork     |  administration
|filled the shelves     |  stock control
|giving free stuff away | promotions
|checked something      |   quality control



## Task 1: Find an advert for a job you want.
1) Find an appropriate CV Template
2) Download it and fill in the details
3) Try to adapt your CV to the job


## Task 2: Cover letter?
Usually you don't just send the CV. You send a short letter:
* introducing yourself
* saying how your skills/experience match each point in the job advert
* Any information they asked for which is not on your CV (e.g. interview availability)
* any other highlights you really don't want them to miss on your cv
* Example below

There are many different styles. 

* UK cover letters tend to be very short (like the example below) 
* US cover letters tend to add more text, about aims/philosophy. 
* Make sure you know what style you need and find more examples. 

 

## Example cover letter
Thanks to HS for the original example. 

This is JUST THE TEXT. Find and follow a template (Word/Drive) for a standard formal business letter (addresses, alignment, margins, etc).



Dear Ms Smith,

I am a fourth-year Science and Engineering student at X University, and I would like to apply for the position of assistant school manager, as advertised on your website.

I am confident that my university course has prepared me for a career as a English school assistant in terms of language skill – please see the attached TOEIC and TOEFL certificates. Although I do not possess any experience as a manager, I was a trainer for new staff for one year in my part-time job at Toho Cinemas. Working there helped me to learn the importance of dealing with customers in a friendly and efficient way, accurate management of reservations, and handling cash. I believe I can apply the skills obtained in the future.

Should you have any queries regarding my application or require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would like to thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Hiromi Suzuki
