# Write a Resume(CV) and Cover Letter

## Warmer Discussion
* Are you doing job hunting (part time or full time)?  
* What part time jobs have you had?
* What job do you want after you graduate?
* Are you interested in English-speaking jobs or jobs overseas? 
* Where do students look for jobs these days?

## C.V. or Resume? Which is which?
* Resume: A one page summary. Work first. More for US and business
* CV: A 2-3 page summary. School first. More for UK and academics.


## Step 1 - Analyse a CV/Resume structure

Look at the examples
* How are they different?
* What are the sections in each?
* What order is each section in? 
* How much information is given
* How are each different from Japanese rirekishou?

## Step 2 - write your own

* Feel free to lie or invent if you don't want to share. 
* Maybe imagine who you MIGHT be in 5-10 years and write THAT resume. 

### If you have no work experience, try these:
* Club/circle/team membership
* Volunteer experience
* Driving license
* Awards (study, sports)
* Sports , Music, Hobbies
* First Aid experience
* What else can you think of?
* WHat words can you use to describe your other experience better? (keen, proficient, qualified, active)

### If you have part-time experience

Make your job sound better

__Instead of:__ Waiter, XYZ Ramen, Shinjuku. I took money, took orders, cleaned toilet.
__Better to say:__ Serving staff, XYZ Ramen, Shinjuku. Responsible for cash handling, customer service and hygiene inspection.

|I...                   |I was responsible for...
|-------------          |------------
|took money             |cash handling
|talked to customers    |customer service
|wrote signs            |publicity
|locked the door        |security
|fixed the door         |maintenance
|cooked                 |food preparation
|cleaned (the kitchen)  |(food) hygiene
|put up Halloween decorations |  décor
|told new staff what to do |   staff training
|organised shift swaps  |   scheduling
|did some paperwork     |  administration
|filled the shelves     |  stock control
|giving free stuff away | promotions
|checked something      |   quality control



## Task 1: Find an advert for a job you want.
* Find an appropriate CV Template
    * Some are available to download (but many are not free)
    * There are some [built into Google](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/148833?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop)
    * I will share one in Classroom.
* Fill in the details. Add sections (e.g. for circles) if you need to
* Try to adapt your CV to the job. 
* Remember to use your circle roles/part time job work as necessary.


## Task 2: Cover letter
* Usually you don't just send the CV. You send a short letter:
    * introducing yourself
    * saying how your skills/experience match those asked for in the job advert
    * giving any information they asked for which is not on your CV (e.g. interview availability)
    * giving any other highlights you really don't want them to miss
* There are different styles. 
    * UK cover letters tend to be very short (like the example below) 
    * US cover letters tend to add more text, about aims/philosophy. 
    * Make sure you know what style you need and find more examples. 

### Cover Letter - Suggested structure and useful language
* 1) Top of letter
    * YOUR name, address, email address, date (top right)

        * Describe why you like company + "For these reasons, I am very interested in applying to your company, and below I will explain why I think I would be a good fit."

    * Print and Sign it if paper application
    * Paste an image of your signature if PDF application
    * Type your name. 

## Cover letter - other tips
* Print the ad as a PDF before you start. If you get an interview and they've deleted the advert, you might not remember what requirements they had. 
* If electronic application, EXPORT AS A PDF unless they request Word. Not everyone has the same software and it could make things weird, especially tables. 
* I aim for (Double spaced), 60-80% of one page 
    * Avoid spilling over to a second page then stopping after 3 lines
    * Avoid half-empty one-page letters
    * Avoid saying too much (single spaced 100% of page will not get read)
* If paper
    * use good paper and a good envelope.
    * fold it neatly
* Spellcheck! 
    * Spellcheck again!
    * Have someone check it for you! Email me if you don't have a proofreader. 
* Spellcheck again!


## Example cover letter
Thanks to HS for the original example. 

This is JUST THE TEXT. Find and follow a template (Word/Drive) for a standard formal business letter (addresses, alignment, margins, etc).



Dear Ms Smith,

I am a fourth-year Science and Engineering student at X University, and I would like to apply for the position of assistant school manager, as advertised on your website.

I am confident that my university course has prepared me for a career as a English school assistant in terms of language skill – please see the attached TOEIC and TOEFL certificates. Although I do not possess any experience as a manager, I was a trainer for new staff for one year in my part-time job at Toho Cinemas. Working there helped me to learn the importance of dealing with customers in a friendly and efficient way, accurate management of reservations, and handling cash. I believe I can apply the skills obtained in the future.

Should you have any queries regarding my application or require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me. I would like to thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

Hiromi Suzuki
