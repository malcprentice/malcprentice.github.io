# Style - Describe Figures and Tables

* A table is a square box full of numbers.
* A figure is anything else:  picture, graph, map, photo, diagram, etc.
* I will show you how to make these in class
    * For the APA rules for formatting Tables and Figures, see Invention manuals
    * For Word formatted examples, see "Style - using Figures and Tables.docx" in the shared materials folder. Ask me for the link. 

This page is about style -  the language you use in the text when you __refer__ to Tables and Figures.

    * comparative phrases (X is less common than Y)

* Other useful styles (these are worksheets, I'll add links later)
    * write a cause-effect sentence about what it means ("The result of this is")
