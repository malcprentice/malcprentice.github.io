## Movies
* Watch a movie, but don't use subtitles if you want to practice listening. That's reading. If you get lost, instead of using subtitles:
    * Download the [transcript](http://www.script-o-rama.com/trans.shtml) 
    * Read ahead.
    * Watch without reading.
    * If you get confused stop, read, understand, read ahead a little, then)
    * Start watching again.

## Songs
* Google "Lyrics for SONG NAME", read and understand.
* THEN listen, many times.
