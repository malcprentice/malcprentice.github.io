# Exams - TOEFL Reading


## Main tips 

TOEFL reading is broadly the same as center test or TOEIC reading. You already know all the main strategies,  a review

* Your main problem is reading speed and time management, so:
    * Do some speed reading
    * Do some reading springs
    * Don't read the whole passage first 
        * Skim it quickly (title, first and last sentences of each paragraph)
        * THen read questions
        * Then Scan for answer. For example, if it says *In paragraph 3, what happens when students close their computers, SKIM for *close computers* in paragraph 3. 
        * Skim not just for keywords from the question, but for synonyms and antonyms i.e. sadness = melancholy = lack of happiness
    * Manage your time. From July 2023, there are 2 readings (total 35 mins), so 17-18 mins each
        * 60s for easy questions like vocab, so you have time for:
        * 2 mins for difficult questions ("not true" / "true except",  infer)
        * 3+ mins for last (which of these) sorting question 
    * If you have a time problem, maybe skip the difficult ones and come back at end of test
        * Maybe skip "..the following are true except"
        * Maybe skip "infer" or "suggests" questions and come back later
* Be aware that the ETS book says there are limited kinds of passages. When skimming, decide
    * Which type is it (usually one of three):
        * explanation/description ("how emotions and feelings are connected")
        * argument ("Why students should do a study abroad") (rare)
        * history (e.g. "nineteenth century politics in the US")
    * Which is the main idea? (usually one of four, you may be asked to identify this). 
        * classification ("is a kind of")
        * compare/contrast ("on the other hand", "same/different", "more/less", "differ in that")
        * cause/effect ("causal relationship", "leads to")
        * problem/solution - same as cause effect but bad and good language too
* the ETS book says there are ten question types. Some are more common than others. 
    * You WILL DEFINITELY get at least one question about  
        * Facts 
            * Examples
                * Which of the following is true
                * X mentions which of the following:
                * According to the paragraph, why

                * Patterns

                    * learn patterns that match the meaning

## General Tips
Again, wrong answers can either wrong meaning, or just not something  essay says
Like inference,   it won't contradict the main passage point
If you don't know a word, guess based on parts you know from other words. 

Be careful of " the most important" in a question. 
It means some answers are true but not correct
Wrong answers can be true but 
indirect / implied but not stated
occasional / partial / 
about subtopic / about example  only, not about topic of paragraph/essay
For Q10, one trick is to prefer ideas which are repeated in more than one paragraph.
