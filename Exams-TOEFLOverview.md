## General tips
* Don't forget your ID with signature and name
* You are expected to take notes. 
    * They will give you paper
    * It will be destroyed after the test. 
* Do NOT listen to the directions. 
    * You should already know what you are doing. 
    * Click CONTINUE and spend your time on the questions/content.
* Get some sleep
* Check your score breakdown, and work on your weakness

## General tips for all speaking
* Record yourself speaking.
* Transcribe yourself and look for problems
* Do the same speech again and again - faster and smoother
* See http://www.ets.org/s/toefl for example answers
* Don't repeat to fill time. Add something
* Practice filling the time until you get it right

## What score do I need?
* 60-80: Some universities will accept lower scores (to take a language course first)
* 71: The average in Japan
* 82: The average score in the world
* 79-105: Programs state a minimum in this range to not be immediately rejected. However...
* 100+: A _good_ university will usually say "100+ iBT to be competitive"
* SOme notes
    * Check the department. Science courses have lower requirements than reading-heavy majors. 
    * Usually, there are also section minimums: e.g. "100, with 23 on the speaking section and 21 on other sections". 
    * Check the page of the course you want. There is also a website for checking what score you need: http//:www.toeflgoanywhere.org
