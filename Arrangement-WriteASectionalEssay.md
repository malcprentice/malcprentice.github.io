# Write A Sectional Essay

## Imagine a normal 5 paragraph outline
* Introduction
* Description Paragraph
* Problems Paragraph
* Solutions Paragraph
* Conclusion

## Here is that second paragraph, expanded to list sentences

* Problems Paragraph
    * Paragraph Topic Sentence "This paragraph outlines"
    * Problem 1
        * Structure sentence ("The first problem is")
        * Detail sentence
        * Detail sentence
    * Problem 2
        * Structure sentence ("The second problem is")
        * Detail sentence
        * Detail sentence
    * Problem 3
        * Structure sentence ("The third problem is")
        * Detail sentence
        * Detail sentence
    * Summary "In summary, this paragraph"
    * Link "The next paragraph looks at"

## What happens if the paragraph gets too long for one paragraph? 

1) Split it into paragraphs! 
2) Now you need to think about adding new topic sentences, links and summaries


## ONE OPTION

* Problems __SECTION__
    * Problem 1
        * __SECTION THESIS STATEMENT__ "This __SECTION__ outlines"
        * __Paragraph Topic__ sentence ("The first problem is")
        * Detail 1 sentence 1
        * Detail 1 sentence 2
        * Detail 2 sentence 1
        * Detail 2 sentence 2    
    * Problem 2
        * __Paragraph Topic__ sentence ("The second problem is")
        * Detail 1 sentence 1
        * Detail 1 sentence 2
        * Detail 2 sentence 1
        * Detail 2 sentence 2  
    * Problem 3
        * __Paragraph Topic__ sentence ("The third problem is")
        * Detail 1 sentence 1
        * Detail 1 sentence 2
        * Detail 2 sentence 1
        * Detail 2 sentence 2  
    * Summary "In summary, this __SECTION__"
    * Link "The next __SECTION__ looks at"


## Notice that 

* Each paragraph does NOT have its own summary and link. 
    * When all paragraphs in a section are the same type (Problem), they're not necessary, 
    * especially if paragraphs are now short. 
* You need more details - at least two main details, two sentences each. Probably more.
