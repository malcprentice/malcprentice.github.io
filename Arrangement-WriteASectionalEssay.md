# Arrangement: Write a Sectional Essay

* Essay paragraph getting too long? You might need to split paragraphs and use sections.
* For example, a 9-11 paragraph problem-solution essay:
    * Introduction section (1 paragraph)
    * Description section (1-3 paragraphs)
    * Problems section (3 paragraphs)
    * Solution section (3 paragraphs)
    * Conclusion section (1 paragraph)

## Add subheadings for each section
* This section is easier to understand if you're looking at the template I sent
* Subheading before every section (except usually Introduction). 
    * Heading 2 style in template, or:
        * 12 pt, left aligned
        * Bold
        * Title Case 
    * Blank line before each subheading
    * Subheading = short  clear version of your section thesis
        * Columbia: Problems with Pollution
        * Comparison of USJ and Disney
        * Issues Experience by Blue Whales
        * USJ and Disney: A Comparison
        * ~~Comparison 2~~   
        * ~~Issues~~



## Careful with how you start the section. 
You need BOTH section thesis AND paragraph topic. e.g. "This SECTION looks at...FIrst this PARAGRAPH examines"

* Problems __Paragraph__
    * __Paragraph Topic Sentence__ "This __paragraph__ outlines three problems..."
    * Problem 1
        * Structure sentence ("The first problem is")
        * Detail sentence 1
        * Detail sentence 2
    * Problem 2 
        * etc

But a problems SECTION might look like this: 

* Problems __SECTION__
    * Problem 1
        * __SECTION THESIS STATEMENT__ "This __SECTION__ outlines three problems..."
        * __ALSO A Paragraph Topic__ sentence ("The first problem is")
        * Detail 1 sentence 1
        * Detail 1 sentence 2
        * Detail 2 sentence 1
        * Detail 2 sentence 2    
    * Problem 2 
        * etc


## Careful how you end the section and paragraph
* Ask yourself - how many summaries do I need? 
    * Paragraphs and section? Only if section is REALLY long.
    * Paragraph summaries only (not recommended, not sure where this would work)
    * End of each section only (recommended for repetitive "three problems" type sections
* Ask yourself - how many links do I need? 
    * Everywhere 
        * "The next paragraph"-"The next paragraph"-"The next paragraph"-"The next section" 
        * Only if each paragraph is different style (e.g. description-proble-solution SECTION
    * Section only 
        * No paragraph summaries. Just "The next section"
        * (better for repetitive "three problems" type section. 

## Style tips
* Bored of "this paragraph...this paragraph"? See the worksheet on topic sentence for alternatives. 
* Be careful with nested style 
    * e.g. don't use "Secondly" in the middle of a paragraph that starts "The third"
    * e.g. don't use "Finally" in the middle of an essay. 
    * Instead, use  "One---Another---Yet another" or alternatives
