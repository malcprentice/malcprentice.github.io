Small Talk

Everything (discussions, presentations, job interviews, meetings) starts with small talk. 

It is important to be good at this, so we will start every class with practice.

# Simple  
* Hiroko:     Hi, how's it going? 
* Emi:        Good. You?  
* Hiroko:     Not bad. Did you do anything at the weekend?
* Emi:        Not really. How about you? 
* Hiroko:     Not much. 
* Emi:        Hey, MAIN TOPIC QUESTION <--
* Hiroko: <--

    * ADD DETAIL! 
    * Ask a new question
* Emi: <--

* Hiroko:     Oh, I've got to go. Class is starting. 
* Emi:        Mine too. See you later. Bye!
* Hiroko:     Bye!

# Make your own!
A conversation has 6 parts: A, B, C, D, E, & F. Do all 6 every time you change partners

## A) Hello +  greeting
Hello   |Greeting
---     |---
Hi      |How's it going?
Hey     |How are things?
Morning |How’ve you been?
Afternoon |What’s new?   
Evening |What's up?
    

There are many more, but usually: 

* A safe answer to "How" questions is "Good. You?"
* A safe answer to  "What" questions "Not much. You?"
                                             
## B) Small talk question
Examples for people you just met:

* What’s your name?       
* Where are you from?                             
* Where do you live   ?      
* What's your major?          
* What classes are you taking?    
* What circles are you in?         

Examples for people you see every week:
* How was the weekend?            
* Any plans for the weekend? 
* Do anything last night?             
* What are you up to tonight?
* How was the holiday?            
* What will you do in the holiday?
* How are classes going?          
* How's work? 
* Or see [ask good questions](Style - Ask Good Questions) sheet

## C) Change the topic
* Hey, 
* So…         
* By the way, ...                 
* Anyway….                
* Oh!                     
* That reminds me...                  
* Oh yeah, did you hear about (+ news)

## D) Fill your silence
Can't think of how to say something? Give yourself some time! Use English sounds!

Any time        |Beginning  |Middle     |End
---             |---        |---        |---
Ummmmm          |It's like  |sorta      |, yeah?
Uh              |Well,      |kinda      |, yknow?
Er              |Maybe,     |like       |, right?         

### Tips
* e.g. "I went to the park" = "Well, I like uhh just sorta went ummm to the park, yknow?" 
    * This is not good, but it's better than silence
    * Use more than one! Not "like...like...like...like...like...like...like...like"
* You can sometimes stretch sounds ("I think you shouuuUUUld read more")

## E) Active Listening
Maybe you learned this in another class. Use it here too!
e.g. "Uh-huh", "I see", "Really", "Do you mean?"
See the  [Communication Skills](Communication Skills)
 
## F) Finish the conversation (three parts)
Stop signal,  reason            |Promise to contact         |Goodbye         
---                             |---                        |---
Alright, I have to go.          |See you around!            |Bye
Oh, my class starting.          |See you at lunch?          |Goodbye
Sorry! My mum's calling me.     |I'll call you later.       |Bye then
OK, this is my floor            |Let's go to X later?       |Cheerio (UK)
Got to run, my bus is coming.   |Speak to you after         |
