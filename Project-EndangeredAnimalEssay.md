# Project - Endangered Animals Essay

## Step 1: Choose an endangered animal
* Browse some animals
    * [WWF list](https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/directory?sort=extinction_status&direction=desc)
    * [IUCN Red list](https://www.iucnredlist.org/search?taxonLevel=Amazing&searchType=species)
* Choose ONE animal
    * Choose something INTERESTING we DO NOT KNOW (i.e. NOT the Giant Panda)
    * Do NOT choose Narwhal (the example essay topic)
    * Choose a SPECIFIC species (i.e. "Amur Tiger", not just "Tiger")
    * Choose something endangered or vulnerable NOT extinct or extinct in wild. 

## Step 2 - Homework
* Read the [example](Example-EndangeredAnimalsEssay.md)
* Read 3 articles about your animal.
    * Japanese OK. 
    * Take notes. 
    * Focus on problems. 
    * If you can't find 3 problems, change your topic. 
    * If you can't find 3 solutions, change your topic. 
    * Avoid bad sources. Try to use good sources

## Step 3 Read more and start writing
* Read three more articles.  
    * English only
    * Take notes - enough detail to speak for 5 minutes on your topic
    * This time, concentrate on description and solution responses. 

## Arrangement and Style
See the work sheets on 
* Write an Introduction Paragraph
* Write a Description Paragraph
* Write a Problems (Cause-Effect) paragraph - see also write a cause-effect paragraph
* Write a Solutions (Summary-Response) Paragraph
* Write a Conclusion paragraps

## Tips for problems research:

If you can't find a problem in the articles you read, try searching for problem keywords AND the name of your animal. 

Common problem keywords are

* habitat destruction
* overdevelopment
* tourism
* deforestation
* climate change
* pollution
* invasive species
* land animals mostly: hunting, or poaching(illegal hunting)
* sea animals mostly: bioaccumulation, bycatch, overfishing, boatstrike
* indirect problems (things that make the problem worse) conflict, corruption
* big mammals: traditional medicine


Common solution keywords are

* NGOs for animal (Save the Tiger), habitat (Mangrove Action PRoject), or general (WWF)
* Wildlife preserves
* Farmer compensation
* Ecotourism
* Sustainable Development
* Laws (national, international, trade agreements like CITES)
Remember that your solutions and problems don't need to match exactly. For example, fixing deforestation fixes hunting (no forest roads, less hunters).  
* Consumer awareness (if the animal is eaten OR if it's habitat is destroyed by food production) e.g. dolphin-safe tuna


## Common mistakes
* You're talking about ALL of an animal group. 
    * You can talk about all memberS, 
    * or THE single species. 
    * Plurals or 'the'. 
        * These animals enjoy eating ice cream
        * The species enjoys eating ice cream
        * Emperor penguins enjoy eating ice cream
        * The Emperor penguin enjoys eating ice cream
    * Don't mix!
        * ~~These animals enjoys eating ice cream~~
        * ~~Species enjoys eating ice cream~~
        * ~~Emperor penguin enjoys eating ice cream~~
* Capitals for place names NOT for animal name
    * Amur tiger, Siberian tiger, Malaysian elephant, Bornean orangutan
    * ~~amur Tiger, siberian tiger, Malaysian Elephant, Bornean Orangutan~~
* Avoid boring definitions. Which of these is boring?
    * e.g. "The Siberian tiger is a kind of tiger from Siberia" 
    * e.g. "The Siberia tiger is the only member of the big cat family which lives in Russia" 
    * Use partition instead for animals like this.
