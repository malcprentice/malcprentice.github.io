# Style - Write a Nested Paragraph

Sometimes you have an paragraph organisation like this. Look at point 2.

* Topic Sentence
* Problem 1 - Child labour
    * Some detail
    * Some detail
* Problem 2 - Pollution
    * Air pollution
    * Soil pollution
    * Sea pollution
* Problem 3 - Poverty
    * Some detail
    * Some detail
* Summary and Link

##  DO NOT do this:

This paragraph describes three problems caused by production of something. __The first problem__ is child labour. Detail on child labour. Detail on child labour. __The second problem__ is pollution, of which there are three main kinds. __The first pollution type__ is air pollution. Detail on air pollution. __The second  pollution type__ is soil pollution. Detail on soil pollution. __The third pollution type__ is sea pollution. Detail on Sea pollution. __The third problem__ is poverty. Detail on poverty. Detail on poverty. In summary, there are three problems - child labour, pollution, and poverty - of which the most serious is poverty, as it causes the other two. However, the next paragraph looks at some possible solutions.

## Can you see how this will be confusing? 
* Only use "First", ONCE! 
* Never use "Finally" in the middle of something

    * Also important is
* Summary and Link
