## What is a topic sentence?
* It must be the first sentence
* Names topic of paragraph
* It links the paragraph to the thesis
	* e.g. thesis says "compares in three ways", topic says "second way is cost"
	* e.g. thesis says " three problems", topic says "Another problem is pollution"
* Sometimes links to previous paragraphs e.g. "A second reason" or "Whereas above"
	
## Simplest version
* A simple, boring, academic style of topic sentence is to just name the topic/keyword 
	* e.g. "The third problem is pollution"
	* e..g. "This paragraph looks at cost"
* All the essay [examples](Index-Examples) use this pattern
* You can just copy and use the examples

## Longer version for longer academic paragraphs/sections
* Use a thesis statement pattern as a topic sentence. 
* See [Style - Write A Thesis Statement](Style-WriteAThesisStatement)
* Just use "paragraph" instead of "Essay"
 	* e.g. "This ~~essay~~ paragraph describes the link between a and b"
 	* e.g. "This ~~essay~~ paragraph outlines three main reason for lack of z"
* This is better if you don't have a sequence of similar paragraphs and you can't use simple
