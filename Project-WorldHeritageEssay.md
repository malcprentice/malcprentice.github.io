# Project - World Heritage Essay

## Overview
World Heritage sites are often cared for very carefully, but this is not always the case. In this essay, lets look at some sites that are in danger. For example:

* Edinburgh: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-15353402
* Istanbul: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11095638
* Liverpool: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-18592334
* Syria: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29255315



# Step 1: Choose a World Heritage site
* List of [sites in danger](https://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/)
* Choose something 
    * **interesting** 
    * we **do not know** 
    * that is in **danger**
    * is **overseas** and **not your home country**(i.e. not kyoto)
* Post it to Classroom Stream. 
    * e.g. "Hi, I'm Hiroko, and I choose Angkor Wat"
    * "First come first served." - if someone else posted your place, choose again!

# Step 2: Research your site
* Research
    * Read 3 articles about your site (Japanese OK)
    * Read 3 more articles (English only)
    * Avoid bad sources (wikipedia, about.com). 
    * Try to use good sources (news, NGO, government sources, etc)
    * Take notes. Try Cornell style. 
* Suggestions for description research:
    * DEFINE "Angkor Wat is a Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia, the largest of its kind in the world"
    * PARTITION "There are two main areas in Angkor Wat - outer and inner - of which...")
    * COMPARE CONTRAST ("Angkor Wat is similar to Kinkakuji in that....however...")
    * TIME ORDER ("Angkor Wat was built in the 12th century by...because.... After that... then... However...")
    * Importance ("This is an important site because..."
    * A number showing the size of the problem (things lost, area destroyed, tourist numbers, etc)
* Suggestions for problem research:  
    * tourism ( garbage, graffiti, vandalism, erosion by feet)
    * theft (for local construction, for souvenirs)
    * destructive  development (roads, dams, hotels)
    * Natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, climate change, wind erosion, rain, 
    * Pollution (air, acid rain)
    * Management (political instability, corruption, lack of interest)
    * conflict (can cause deliberate damage, accidental, or just interrupt maintenance)
* Suggestions for solutions research (prevention or restoration)
    * Organisations (UNESCO, NGOs, national groups)
    * Changes to tourism (ecotourism, number limits, building new infrastructure visitors are stressing)
    * Transferring things to museums
    * Repairing / Restoring
    * Solving related issues that make things worse (local poverty, corruption, conflict)

* Conclusion
    * Conclusion Topic sentence = Thesis statement in other words and in past tense
    * Summary of ESSAY (you could just repeat the paragraph summaries, but that's boring.) 
    * Final Comment (A recommendation. I will explain more in class)
