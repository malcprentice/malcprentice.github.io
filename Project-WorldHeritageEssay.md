## Overview
Do you know [how world heritage sites are chosen?](http://whc.unesco.org/en/criteria/)
Do you think world heritage sites are a [good idea?](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cumbria-25682571)

World Heritage sites are often cared for very carefully, but this is not always the case:

* Edinburgh: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-15353402
* Istanbul: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11095638
* Liverpool: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-18592334
* Syria: http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29255315

In this essay, lets look at some sites that are in danger. 

# Step 1: Choose a World Heritage site
* List of [sites in danger](https://whc.unesco.org/en/danger/)
* Choose something 
    * INTERESTING 
    * we DO NOT KNOW 
    * that is IN DANGER
    * in ANOTHER COUNTRY (i.e. NOT Kyoto)
* Post it to Classroom. First come first served.


# Step 2: Research your site
* Read 3 articles about your site (Japanese OK)
* Read 3 more articles (English only)
* Avoid bad sources. Try to use good sources
* Suggestions for description research:
    * DEFINE "Angkor Wat is a Buddhist temple complex in Cambodia, the largest of its kind in the world"
    * PARTITION "There are two main areas in Angkor Wat - outer and inner - of which...")
    * COMPARE CONTRAST ("Angkor Wat is similar to Kinkakuji in that....however...")
    * TIME ORDER ("Angkor Wat was built in the 12th century by...because.... After that... then... However...")
    * A number showing the size of the problem (things lost, area destroyed, tourist numbers, etc)
* Suggestions for problem research:  
    * tourism ( garbage, graffiti, vandalism, erosion by feet)
    * theft (for local construction, for souvenirs)
    * destructive  development (roads, dams, hotels)
    * Natural disasters (e.g. earthquake, climate change, wind erosion, rain, 
    * Pollution (air, acid rain)
    * Management (political instability, corruption, lack of interest)
    * conflict (can cause deliberate damage, accidental, or just interrupt maintenance)
* Suggestions for solutions research (prevention or restoration)
    * Organisations (UNESCO, NGOs, national groups)
    * Changes to tourism (ecotourism, number limits, building new infrastructure visitors are stressing)
    * Transferring things to museums
    * Repairing / Restoring
    * Solving related issues that make things worse (local poverty, corruption, conflict)
