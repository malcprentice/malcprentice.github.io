# Exams - TOEFL Listening


## Main tips 
* In preparation
    * Make sure you know the basic word list and the AWL list at a minimum. Ask me to share vocab list if I haven't already. 
    * Your main problem is listening speed and vocab for the two kinds of listening: campus life and lecture. 
        * Look at my [list of news sites](https://alba-english.org/Resources-NewsSites.html) - at the bottom are some US campus newspapers. Look for local interest topics - people retiring, campus issues, announcements. THis is the kind of thing that might come up in the "campus" as opposed to "lecture" content. 
        * Look at the bottom of my  [Listening Resources][Resources-Listening] list - Focus on lecture materials - Ted Talks, Big Think, Coursera - but any listening will help with listening fluency (Harry Potter audiobooks, podcasts, whatever helps you listen a lot). 
        * Listen at different speeds
            * If it's too fast, don't give up. Slow it down first. THen listen again at normal speed, or even faster.  
            * THis option is built into podcast apps, some websites.  
            * For downloadable audio, if your phone app doesn't help try  [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)
* Before listening, use your normal exam strategies to get your brain ready.  
    * Skim the questions quickly 
    * Then read answers
    * Guess the context
* While listening    
    * Answer while listening - you won't be able to guess afterwards. TOEFL has a LOT of "this is probably true, but not the right answer" options. 
    * IF you have to guess
        * Synonyms (同義語) and antonyms (反意語) are probably a good sign  i.e. sadness = melancholy = lack of happiness
        * But unlike some TOEIC sections, hearing and reading the same word isn't an immediate no. 
* After listening 
    * Answer quickly and move on to read the questions for the next listening. 
    * DOn't spend too much time guessing - see above.
