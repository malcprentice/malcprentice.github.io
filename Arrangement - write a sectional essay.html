        	<p>	Once your essays get longer than 5 paragraphs, you need to use sections. </p>
	<p>	This will be clearer if you read some examples and templates. </p>
<ul><li>	Template for Essay - Sectional 9 paragraph Problem-Solution </li>
<li>	Template for Essay Outline - Sectional 9 paragraph Problem-Solution </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	A sectional essay needs subheadings and extra thesis statements </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id="Subheadings">	Subheadings </h3>
	<p>	bold, <a href="Style - use title case.html">use title case</a>, subheading, and LEFT aligned </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id="A thesis statements for each section">	A thesis statements for each section </h3>
	<p>	IN ADDITION to the topic sentence for the first paragraph </p>
<ul><li>	"This section describes....This paragraph outlines...THe first" </li>
<li>	"This section looks at X in terms of ABC. This paragraph focuses on A, specifically 1, 2, and 3. The first A is 1. ") </li>
<li>	For more options (and to avoid "This...This..."), read up on how to <a href="Arrangement - write a paragraph topic sentence.html">write a paragraph topic sentence</a> </li>
<li>	Your section is usually three similar paragraphs, or one long point. So you don't usually need keywords for the thesis statement, just the topic sentence of each paragraph "This section describes three problems. This first problem is pollution....The second problem is child labour....The third..." </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id="Tips">	Tips </h2>
	<p>	<red>1) Don't confuse paragraph cohesion with section cohesion </p>
<ul><li>	Your section starts "This <strong> section </strong> " </li>
<li>	Your section ends  "In summary this <strong> section </strong> ... The next <strong> section </strong> " </li>
<li>	Your paragraphs start "This <strong> paragraph </strong> " </li>
<li>	Your paragraphs maybe DO NOT end with a summary/link (see 3 below) </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	<red>2) Try not confuse your order numbering</red> </p>
<ul><li>	e.g. "Secondly, problem 2. Firstly, problem 2 point 1." is confusing </li>
<li>	e.g. Using "Finally" in the second paragraph of a three paragraph section is confusing </li>
<li>	If you're not sure, perhaps try "One---Another---Yet another" of one of the other patterns you can find here: <a href="Style - use cohesion.html">use cohesion</a> </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	3) Do NOT summarize OR link simple sections </p>
<ul><li>	For example, inside sections with "three problems" or "three solutions" style content. </li>
<li>	Do NOT end your second problem paragraph with "In summary...The next paragraph" </li>
<li>	This section is so simple that summarizing and linking is unnecessary. </li>
<li>	Just remember to summarise and link the SECTION at the end of the third paragraph (e.g. "In summary, this section looked at three problems facing the Red Panda, of which the most serious was hunting. The next section looks at three possible solutions to these problems") </li>
<li>	DO LINK (but do not summarize) complex sections. For example, if your section is a description, and contains a comparison paragraph, a definition paragraph, and a process paragraph, you MUST link so I know what is coming next. However, as with most description paragraphs, probably better with no siummary </li>
</ul>
