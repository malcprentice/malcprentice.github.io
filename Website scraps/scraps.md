* Take rough notes
* Focus on important Names/Numbers/Dates/Facts/Reasons/Examples
* CHeck your syllabus for the target
* A good article is something INTERESTING your partner MIGHT NOT KNOW
** not "Tokyo Sky Tree Opens" (everyone knows the story already)
** not "Daisuke Matsui transfers to Slavia Sofia" (not everyone likes football)
* Most students say they take 50-60 minutes to do this report.


## 1) For a news article:
Visit [[Resources - websites for English news articles]]
* Choose a site.
* Choose an interesting section on the site
** The front page is often boring: Tech/Business might be more interesting, depending on your major
* Choose an article.
** The "Simplified" category should not be used by some classes. Check your syllabus!
** Internet news (e.g. Yahoo) is often shorter and easier
** News indexes (Google, Reuters) are good for finding a topic
* Read critically
** Many newspapers are politically biased.
** Some are tightly controlled by different governments or groups.
** Try to read more than one source/side before you believe anything you read.
* APA reference for News Website is here: http://alba-english.org/Invention%20-%20use%20APA%20format%20for%20reference%20lists.html# Newspaper
 

## For an easy book
### 1) Get a book
* Non-fiction is best for RR outline. Fiction is OK for logs.
* You can borrow books from the library(1F, far right wall).
* You can read books in Space, but not borrow them.
* If you are not on campus, try ER Central: http://www.er-central.com/
* Read the first page. It should be easy
** you should know 98% of the words without a dictionary
** if you don't, go down a level.

### 2) Read it
* You only need to read for 30 minutes.
* You can do your RR even if you haven't finished the book.
* Do try to finish the book later though

### 3) Doing an RR outline? Follow the general instructions
* Instructions are here: [[Projects - outline]]
* APA reference for the References section is here: http://alba-english.org/Invention%20-%20use%20APA%20format%20in%20reference%20lists.html# Graded Readers
* APA for your Summary is here: [[Invention - use APA format in the text]]

### Finished your RR outline? Remember!
* Reading improves your English, including TOEIC score: http://jalt-publications.org/archive/proceedings/2009/E035.pd
* Check your syllabus for details - you might be able to get extra points for more reading



##  For a difficult reading of another kind
* Read the summary/description (if available)
* Try to guess what the author will say
* Skim the first and last paragraph
* Read the summary/abstract, if there is one.
* Read the whole thing. Option: highlight the interesting points
* Take rough notes on scrap paper
* Do you have enough notesd for a 3-4 minute presentation? If not, read again or read a second article

## For a song
When I ask beginning first-year students with good English, particularly good pronunciation, where they learned, I usually get two answers:
* study abroad
* listened to song lyrics

So if I say "Free Topic" for RR, one option available is to use song lyrics.

However, its more than just listening to a song. You should:
* download the lyrics
* read them carefully and try to understand 100%
* listen multiple times until you can hear the words in the song
* optional: do it in karaoke!
* Lyrics Training: http://lyricstraining.com/ (also handy for typing practice)
* Lyrics search: http://azlyrics.com  (or just Google song name plus "lyrics")
