For your class project, I recommend an Interview.
A "survey" basically means an Interviews or a Questionnaire
This page is about shared issues, and how to choose between them. 
For specific tips see:
* [[Research - do an interview]]
* [[Research - make a questionnaire]]

|Everyone will probably finish 			|Many questionnaires will go in bin
|Flexible - you can add questions 		|Fixed - once you send it you canâ€™t change
|Hard to analyse (transcribe, code)  	|Easier to analyse (especially if closed)
|Interviewer can change (bias) questions |Questions always the same (reliable)
|Can see body language, expressions   	|No body language, etc.

### My recommendation
Interviews are best for finding out what a few people think/do when you are not sure. 
Questionnaires are best for checking something is true with a large number of people

This means interviews are better than questionnaires for undergraduate projects because usually:
* You will have a small number of subjects
* You don't know exactly what you are looking for ...
* ...so it is hard to write good questionnaire questions
* You can change interviews as you learn - you don't have to perfect first time
