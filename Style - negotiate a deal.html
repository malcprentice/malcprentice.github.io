<h2 id=" Task 2: Monopoly">	 Task 2: Monopoly </h2>
	<p>	The rules are similar to "Jinsei Game". I will explain in class. </p>
<h4>	 Game language </h4>
<ul><li>	 Your turn. </li>
<li>	 Is it my turn? </li>
<li>	 Can you move my token 3 squares? It's the boot. </li>
<li>	 Can you pass me a chance card? </li>
<li>	 Can you pass the dice? </li>
<li>	 I'd like to buy this property please </li>
<li>	 That's mine. Please pay $32 ("32 dollars") rent </li>
<li>	 Here you are. </li>

</ul><h4>	 Banker language </h4>
<ul><li>	 Would you like to buy it? </li>
<li>	 Here you are. </li>
<li>	 If you want to get out of jail, you can pay... </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Useful language">	 Useful language </h2>
<h3 id=" Proposal (offer, suggestion)">	 Proposal (offer, suggestion) </h3>
<ul><li>	 If you X I will Y (high chance of X) </li>
<li>	 If you Xed I would Y (low chance of X) </li>
<li>	 If I X, will you </li>
<li>	 If I Xed, would you </li>
<li>	 I'll give you two choices - either X or Y </li>
<li>	 I propose we VERB </li>
<li>	 How about we VERB </li>
<li>	 Would it be possible to X </li>
<li>	 How would you feel if we Xed... </li>
<li>	 Do you think you could consider Xing </li>
<li>	 How about you do X and I do Y? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Checking at the end of a long proposal">	 Checking at the end of a long proposal </h3>
<ul><li>	 Is that OK with you? </li>
<li>	 How does that sound? </li>
<li>	 Would that work? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Clarifying a proposal">	 Clarifying a proposal </h3>
<ul><li>	 So, you mean.... </li>
<li>	 XXXX - that's correct, isn't it? </li>
<li>	 Could you just summarise that for me one more time? </li>
<li>	 Can you give me an example? </li>
<li>	 So what I think you're saying is X. Is that right? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Asking for more room or time">	 Asking for more room or time </h3>
<ul><li>	 Can you give me some time to talk to my partner? </li>
<li>	 I'll have to check with my boss </li>
<li>	 Are you flexible on that number? </li>
<li>	 Would you be willing to... </li>
<li>	 Could we compromise on... </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Refusing">	 Refusing </h3>
<ul><li>	 I'm sorry, but that doesn't work for us. </li>
<li>	 I don't think that's going to work. </li>
<li>	 I'm afraid we can't do that. </li>
<li>	 Unfortunately, that's not quite... </li>
<li>	 That's a fair offer, but... </li>
<li>	 I'm sorry, but we can't accept that. </li>
<li>	 That would be quite difficult. </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Accepting">	 Accepting </h3>
<ul><li>	 Great! </li>
<li>	 Done! </li>
<li>	 Deal! </li>
<li>	 I believe we have a deal! </li>
<li>	 That's sounds reasonable. Let's do it. </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Accepting with conditions">	 Accepting with conditions </h3>
<ul><li>	 Done, but only on the condition that X. </li>
<li>	 OK, but we're going to have to insist that... </li>
<li>	 As long as X, then we have a deal. </li>
<li>	 We would be willing to accept that only if </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Counter proposal">	 Counter proposal </h3>
	<p>	Use one of these plus another offer phrase: </p>
<ul><li>	 Instead,... </li>
<li>	 May I offer an alternative?.... </li>
<li>	 THat might work. But perhaps </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Closing">	 Closing </h3>
<ul><li>	 OK, just to check. You will... and we will... </li>
<li>	 SO, what we agreed on was to X and Y </li>
<li>	 Let's just summarise... </li>
<li>	 It was a pleasure doing business with you. </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
