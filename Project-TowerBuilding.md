# Project - Tower Building



* __Materials:__ 5 sheets of A4 paper and 1m of tape
* __Aim:__ Make the tallest tower you can. 
    * It should be “free standing”
    * no taping it to wall/ceiling, not leaning on wall, no holding it

## Step 1: Planning

Make a plan. Please use discussion language 
* What should we do first?
* Why don't we / We should
* I totally agree 
* etc)

* Suggested plan discussion questions
    * How can we make it strong and tall? 
    * How many legs should we have? 
    * How many sheets should we use per leg? How about for the tower?
    * Should we roll tightly or rolol loosely
    * How should we use the tape?
    * We don't have much time. How should we share the work?



## Step 2: Make your tower

* Use polite instruction language
    * Hiroki, can you roll/fold
    * Hiroko, can you give me 1cm of tape?
    * Hiroki, while I X, can you Y?
    * Can you hold this while I X?
* If it isn't working, change the plan
    * Oh no, our plan isn:t working. We should… 
    * Maybe we need to....

## Step 3: Judge!
* Stop. 
* I will measure your tower. Tallest one to not fall over wins!

## Step 4: Review - practice giving advice
* Give advice to a future class. 
* Think about design AND construction teamwork
    * What went well? What __should__ a future team do?
    * What went badly? What __shouldn't__ a future team do?
* What language did you need that you didn't know? 
    * e.g. Parts
        * The base
        * The braces
    * Verbs
        * Stick 
        * Attach

## Step 5: Recycle!
* Take a photo of your tower
* Destroy your tower carefully
* Use the paper or put it in the right bin
