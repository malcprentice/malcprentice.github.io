# Project - Tower Building

This is a team work activity, I've used before to help companies place new employees for ability to work together with others in English. The aim is to practice discussion language, working in teams language, giving polite suggestion/instruction language, teamwork, etc. 



* __Materials:__ 5 sheets of A4 paper and 1m of tape
* __Aim:__ Make the tallest tower you can. 
    * It should be “free standing” on the floor
    * No taping it to the floor
    * No taping it to the ceiling, other students, etc
    * No wearing it as a hat, leaning it on wall, or holding it

## Step 1: Make a plan

* Suggested plan discussion questions
    * How can we make it strong and tall? 
    * How many legs should we have? 
    * How many sheets should we use per leg? How about for the tower?
    * Should we roll tightly, roll loosely, or make triangles?
    * How should we use the tape?
    * We don't have much time. How should we share the work?
* Please use discussion language 
    * What should we discuss first
    * Why don't we / We should
    * I totally agree 
    * etc


## Step 2: Make your tower

* Use polite instruction/suggestion language
    * Hiroki, can you roll/fold
    * Hiroko, can you give me 1cm of tape?
    * Hiroki, while I X, can you Y?
    * Hiroko, Can you hold this while I X?
    * Hiroki, maybe you could ...
    * Hiroko, why don't you ...
* If it isn't working, change the plan
    * Oh no, our plan isn't working. We should… 
    * Maybe we need to....

## Step 3: Judge!
* Stop. 
* I will measure your tower. Tallest one to not fall over wins!

## Step 4: Review - practice giving advice
* Give advice to a future class. 
* Think about design AND construction teamwork
    * What went well? What __should__ a future team do?
    * What went badly? What __shouldn't__ a future team do?
* What language did you need that you didn't know? 
    * e.g. Parts
        * The base
        * The braces
    * Verbs
        * Stick 
        * Attach

## Step 5: Recycle!
* Take a photo of your tower
* Destroy your tower carefully
* Use the paper or put it in the right bin
