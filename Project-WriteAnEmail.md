## 1) Subject Line
Put your Name and a few words about the email contents. If you are emailing about class, say which class! 
* Hiroko Sato - ECB - Class 2 Homework 2
* Hiroko Sato - SSGB - Question about Thursday homework
* Hiroko Sato - ECB - Essay outline
* If I gave you a homework code or name, use it (e.g. Paragraph A Draft 2, or "A2")

## 2) Start with a greeting
* "Malc,"             Very informal, usually friends. 
* "Hi Malc,"              Informal. Use this one for me!
* "Dear Mr Prentice,"         Formal. If you use this one I will think you are in trouble :-) 
* "To Whom it May Concern:"  Try not to use this. Find out who you are emailing
* "Dear Sir/Madam,"       Try not to use this. Find out who you are emailing
* "Hi, Everyone"          Informal, emailing a group of friends
* "Dear All, "                Semi-formal to a group (I use this for work emails)

## 3) If you haven't emailed someone in a while
* Ask a question first 
    * "I hope you are well."
    * "How have you been?"
    * "How are things?"
* You see me every week, so you don't need this when you email me now. Maybe after a few years


## 4) Say the main thing
* For class emails, for example this would be 
    * "Please find attached my Essay C3"
    * "I was absent on Tuesday - can you tell me my team name"
    * "Here is my homework"
    * "Here is my report. Sorry it is late. "
    * "I was sick last week. Can I have an extension on A3"

## 5) Add a thanks/hope phrase (optional for informal emails)
* Thanks in advance.      if it's something normal like marking an essay or sending info
* I hope you can help.        if it's something less common, like a reference
* I hope to hear from you.        if you're expecting a reply - quite formal
* Let me know         informal - if there's a chance they'll say "no"

## 6) Add a polite written goodbye phrase
Be careful - most have commas not periods

* Nothing             Very informal.  People you know very well. 
* Cheers,         Very informal.  People you know very well. 
* Best,               Informal.       People you know very well
* Regards,            Semi-formal     I use this for work. Use it for me!
* Best Regards,       ?? I've seen this used both ways. Maybe avoid.  
* Yours,          Formal      People you know
* Your sincerely,         Formal          You started "Dear Mr. Smith,"
* Yours faithfully,       Formal      You started "Dear Sir/Madam"

## 7) Your name
If a class email, also give your student number in brackets

Regards,

Hiroko Sato (20150001) 


## Warning about footers
* Ignore the "Footer". 
* Your email will maybe automatically add something like this:
    * 鈴木大志　（ペンギン大学）　経営学部経営学科
    * e1659abc@myuniversityaddress.ac.jp
    * 学籍番号　e1659abc
* This is OK, but it comes AFTER and IN ADDITION to "Regards, Hiroko" or similar. 

## Other tips
* Rename your attachments helpfully
    * Hiroko Sato-SSGB-RR1.docx
    * Hiroko Sato-ECB- AOutline.docx
    * Not 
        * Document1.docx
        * Hiroko.docx
        * A3.docx
