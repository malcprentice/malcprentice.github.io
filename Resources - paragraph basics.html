        	<p>	In this unit, you will learn how to write a good paragraph.   </p>
<ul><li>	 This page takes a bad paragraph, and makes it better.  </li>
<li>	 For quickwrites, only worry about 2, 3, and maybe 4 </li>
<li>	 For essays, worry about ALL these points </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 1 - A bad answer to "Write about your last holiday" </h4>
<blockquote>	 The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see.  </blockquote>
<blockquote>	 I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains.  </blockquote>
<blockquote>	 When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too. </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 2 </h4>
<blockquote>	The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too. </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 Paragraph 2 is better because <strong> it doesn't start every sentence on a new line </strong> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 3 </h4>
<blockquote>	In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too.  </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 Paragraph 3 is better because <strong> it starts with a topic sentence </strong> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 4 </h4>
<blockquote>	In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too. I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better. </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 Paragraph 4 is better because <strong> it ends with a conclusion/recommendation sentence, which you need if there is only one paragraph </strong> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	  </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 5 </h4>
<blockquote>	In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, and I got sick. There was a lot to see - castles, some museums,and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better. </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 Paragraph 5 is better because <strong> there is now one bad point sentence and one good point sentence, not two setences of mixed bad and good </strong> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 6 </h4>
<blockquote>	 In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. On one hand, the weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, and I got sick. However, I saw some castles, some museums, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. In summary, I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better. </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 Paragraph 6 is better because <strong> you can EASILY SEE that there is one bad point sentence and one good point sentence, using "On one hand...However" </strong> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 7 </h4>
<blockquote>	 In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. On one hand, the weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, and I got sick. However, I saw some castles, some museums, and went hiking in some beautiful mountains. In summary, I recommend you visit Scotland, but go in August, because the weather will be better. </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 Paragraph 7 is better because <strong> it has been checked for spelling ("beautiful") and grammar ("play hiking") </strong> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
