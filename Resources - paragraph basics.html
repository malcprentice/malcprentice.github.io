<h4>	Here is a very short, bad paragraph </h4>
	<p>	The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. </p>
	<p>	I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains. </p>
	<p>	When I was younger I went to Kyoto - it had a castle too.  </p>

	<p>	In my winter holidays this year I went to Scotland - I enjoyed the trip, but there were bad points and good points. The weather was terrible, and the food wasn’t so good, but there was a lot to see. I saw some castles, some museums, got sick, and played hiking in some beatiful mountains.
