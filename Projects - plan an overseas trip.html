        <h2 id=" Aim">	 Aim </h2>
	<p>	In this report, we want to practice: </p>
<ul><li>	 Combining sources into one outline </li>
<li>	 Writing short summaries combining more than one source </li>
<li>	 Citing websites </li>
<li>	 Citing Japanese sources </li>
<li>	 Writing reference lists with more than one source </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	We also want to learn about opportunites for going abroad while at University. If you do not learn now, by the time you decide to go it might be too late - you might be busy with jobhunting, dissertation, or you might not be able to get the TOEFL/IELTS score you need. </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Discussion">	 Discussion </h2>
	<p>	People go abroad for many reasons. </p>
<ul><li>	 Travel </li>
<li>	 Study abroad:  <a href="http://www.soka.ac.jp/international/outbound/program"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Work/Internship </li>
<li>	 Working holiday (only some countries):  <a href="http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/w_holiday/"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Volunteering:  <a href="http://idealist.org"> (link) </a> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	1) Do you want to go abroad? For which reason? </p>
	<p>	2) Can you think of any more reasons people go abroad? </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Process">	 Process </h2>
<h3 id=" 1) Do some Research">	 1) Do some Research </h3>
	<p>	1) Choose something you can do while you are in university: "Volunteer", "Internship" or "Study Abroad" </p>
	<p>	2) Choose a specific place </p>
<ul><li>	 e.g. if you research "Study", choose ONE city, ONE university and a specific course </li>
<li>	 e.g. if you choose "Internship"", choose ONE city and ONE company </li>
<li>	 e.g. if you choose "Volunteer", choose ONE organisation working in ONE area </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Choose something INTERESTING your partner DOES NOT KNOW (i.e. no SUA)! </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" 2) Find some good sources to learn about your options">	 2) Find some good sources to learn about your options </h3>
	<p>	Start with the links above. </p>
	<p>	Probably your other sites are the university site, and a travel site. </p>
<ul><li>	 No Wikipedia or Wikitravel. </li>
<li>	 At least three sources </li>
<li>	 At least one Japanese source </li>
<li>	 At least two non-Japanese sources </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" 3) Research you need to know before you go.">	 3) Research you need to know before you go. </h3>
	<p>	Here are some ideas </p>
<ul><li>	 Application: What skills do you need? What forms/proof do you need? </li>
<li>	 What scores/paperwork I need by when? (e.g. TOEFL iBT by October, Visa by December) </li>
<li>	 Action: What will you actually do? Where will you live? </li>
<li>	 Time: When to go, how long? What's the weather like then? </li>
<li>	 Transport: How to get there. How to get around. </li>
<li>	 Language: What English level do I need? Should I learn another language? </li>
<li>	 Cost: Flights, food & accomodation, program fees, application fees, shopping </li>
<li>	 Travel: Other things you can do/eat/see/buy (as travel) while you are there </li>
<li>	 Planning: What do I need to prepare? (visa/vaccine/papers/study) </li>
<li>	 Customs: What customs/manners/cultural things do I need to know? What are people like? </li>
<li>	 Packing:What do I need to take? (special clothes/medicine </li>
<li>	 Warnings: Are there any dangers? (food/water/place/animal/diseases/people/time) </li>
<li>	 Sharing: Will I need to share info about Japan? Should I prepare something? </li>
<li>	 Should I take any gifts from Japan? </li>

</ul>	<p>	Can you think of any more things you might need to know? </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	For the actual details, I have some actual tips on how to <a href="Resources - plan a trip.html">plan a trip</a> in the Resources section. </p>

<li>	 Do you think this will help others? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" 5) Next, prepare to outline the pattern, with some differences">	 5) Next, prepare to outline the pattern, with some differences </h3>
	<p>	See <a href="Projects - outline.html">outline</a> </p>
<h4>	 Your title is: </h4>
<ul><li>	 "Studying at KJHLKJHKJL University" </li>
<li>	 "Volunteering with X NGO" </li>
<li>	 "Working at X company" </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Cite every line </h4>
	<p>	Each point in your outline could come from any of your three references. </p>
<ul><li>	 Please show in your outline WHICH fact comes from WHICH reference </li>
<li>	 Use a citation for every point or detail ("Title of page," n.d.). </li>
<li>	 See the template for an example. </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Don't forget to write three interesting questions </h4>
	<p>	These questions are not interesting: </p>
<ul><li>	 <strike>"Do you want to study abroad" </strike> </li>
<li>	 <strike>"Do you want to go to Canada" </strike> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Don't forget your summary </h4>
	<p>	For the summary, please give a TWO SENTENCE summary. </p>
<ul><li>	 Summarize your plan. </li>
<li>	 Summarize the most important thing you need to do to make your plan come true </li>
<li>	 (e.g. "I'm going to visit UBC in Canada in summer 2017, and study Marketing for one semester. To do this, I really need to save more money, so I will get a part time job soon. I also need to get my iBT TOEFL score up to 90") </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Don't forget your APA reference list </h4>
	<p>	This report is different. </p>
<ul><li>	 Please give THREE references </li>
<li>	 APA reference lists should be in alphabetical order </li>
<li>	 If you use a Japanese site, use <strong> translation </strong> style </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
