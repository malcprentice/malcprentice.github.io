## Citing newspapers
* Follow the basics: 
    * Cite as much of the date as you can find
        * Penguins are cute (Suzuki, 2023, April 23).
        * Newspapers ALWAYS have a date. Check everywhere, including the http address.
        * If not, 
            * Are you sure this is a newspaper, not a website?
            * Is it maybe a website page on a newspaper website? 
            * Ask me if you need help. 
    * If there is no human name, use 2-3 words of the article title ("Penguins overview," 2023, April 23) 
* IF there is a name, you could also try Sentence Style 
    * According to Suzuki (2023, April 23), penguins are cute. 
    * See [Invention-CiteSentenceStyle](Invention-CiteSentenceStyle)
* Remember
    * The newspaper name is never the author 
        * Never do this ~~(Yomiuri Shimbun, 2023, April 4)~~
        * It should be a name (Suzuki, 2023, April 4) or a title ("Penguins," 2023 April 4)
