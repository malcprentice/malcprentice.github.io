Small Talk

Everything (discussions, presentations, job interviews, meetings) starts with small talk. 
It is important to be good at this, so we will start every class with practice.

# Simple  
* Hiroko:     Hi, how's it going? 
* Emi:        Good. You?  
* Hiroko:     Not bad. Did you do anything at the weekend?
* Emi:        Not really. How about you? 
* Hiroko:     Not much. Hey, MAIN TOPIC QUESTION

    * ADD DETAIL!

# Make your own!
A conversation has 6 parts: A, B, C, D, E, & F. Do all 6 every time you change partners

## A) Hello +  greeting
Hi  Hey     Morning     Afternoon   Evening 
    
How's it going? How are things? How’ve you been?    ->  Good. You?
What’s new?     What's up?                      ->  Not much. You?
                                             
## B) Small talk question
Examples for people you just met:
* What’s your name?       
* Where are you from?                             
* Where do you live   ?      
* What's your major?          
* What classes are you taking?    
* What circles are you in?         

Examples for people you see every week:
* How was the weekend?            
* Any plans for the weekend? 
* Do anything last night?             
* What are you up to tonight?
* How was the holiday?            
* What will you do in the holiday?
* How are classes going?          
* How's work? 
* Or see [ask good questions](Style - Ask Good Questions) sheet

## C) Change the topic
* Hey, 
* So…         
* By the way, ...                 
* Anyway….                
* Oh!                     
* That reminds me...                  
* Oh yeah, did you hear about (+ news)

## D) Fill your silence
Can't think of how to say something? Give yourself some time! Use English sounds!

* Any time    
    * Ummmmm   
    * Uh     
    * Er
    * I mean, 
* Beginning       
    * it's like
    * Well, 
    * See, 
    * Maybe, 
* Middle     
    * sorta
    * kinda
    * like
* End
    * , yeah?
    * , yknow?
    * , right?
    

### Tips
* e.g. "I went to the park" = "Well, I like uhh just sorta went ummm to the park, yknow?" 
    * This is not good, but it's better than silence
    * Use more than one! Not "like...like...like...like...like...like...like...like"
* You can sometimes stretch sounds ("I think you shouuuUUUld read more")

## E) Active Listening
Maybe you learned this in another class. Use it here too!
e.g. "Uh-huh", "I see", "Really", "Do you mean?"
See the  [Communication Skills](Communication Skills)
 
## F) Finish the conversation (three parts)
1) Stop signal,  reason    
* Alright, I have to go. 
* Oh, my class starting.   
* Sorry! My mum's calling me.     
* OK, this is my floor 
* Got to run.     My bus is coming.   
2) Promise to contact       
* See you around!   
* See you at lunch? 
* I'll call you later.
* Let's go to X later? 
* Speak to you after 
3) Goodbye
* Bye
* Goodbye
* Bye then
* Cheerio (UK)
