	<p>	Take handwritten notes first. Be ready to present your country next class. </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 1) Choose a country. One area per student if possible. Get some general background  </h4>
	<p>	Try the UNHCR website:  <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/"> (link) </a> </p>
<ul><li>	 e.g. how many refugees/asylum seekers in the world.  </li>
<li>	 e.g. how many in Japan? Do you notice anything about the numbers? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 2) Choose and research one UNHCR emergency area </h4>
	<p>	Choose one of these:  <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/"> (link) </a> </p>
	<p>	Do NOT write section 1 about "Mediterranean"/"Central America" </p>
<ul><li>	 Write section 1 (Background) about a specific ORIGIN country in that area, as the reasons people are fleeing might be different </li>
<li>	 Write section 2 and 3 (Problems/Solutions) about issues experienced in the HOST country. Nationalities are maybe mixed together, so write about general issues of HOST country, no need to google specifically about origin country.  </li>
<li>	 For example, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala all have slightly different issues to describe in Section 1, so choose one (e.g. El Salvador) and explain that history in Section 1. Howeve, people from all three countries have a shared experience on the journey through Mexico into the US, so your Problems and Solutions sections will be about that, not specifically about the experience in Mexico/the US of people from El Salvador. </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Follow the essay pattern </h4>
<ul><li>	 Essay section 1: What happened that your area is producing asylum seekers and refugees (3 time order stages OR 3 reasons/causes OR 3 groups) </li>
<li>	 Essay section 2: Problems and Solutions experienced by refugees or asylum seekers in one place they end up. </li>
<li>	 YOu need to CHOOSE what kind of essay you will write. Either write about problems experience by refugees in camps in nearby countries, or write about problems experienced by asylum seekers and refugees who escape the problems in those camps by going to the first world </li>
<ul><li>	 Camp problems are usually lack of food/water/medicine/education for children/sanitation/overcrowding/disease/recruitment as child soldiers/human trafficking. Here are a some example links:  <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/barat_ali_batoor_my_desperate_journey_with_a_human_smuggler"> (link) </a>  <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/05/what-it-s-be-somali-refugee-kenya"> (link) </a>  </li>
<li>	 First world asylum seeker problems ( in germany, UK, Japan) are usually language, lack of acceptance, racist attacks, losy paperwork, inability to work while applying, nowhere to sleep, lack of access to help.  </li>
<li>	 Solutions in both cases are usually government or NGO charities: either to solve practical issues (food, medicine, money, shelter) or paperwork/language issues.  </li>
<li>	 However, poorly run first world asylum seeker systems (e.g. Australia) focusing on detention centers might have problems and solutions similar to the "Camp" problems </li>
