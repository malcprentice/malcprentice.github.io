<blockquote>	UNHCR was set up in 1951 to help the estimated 1 million people still uprooted after World War II to return home. Since then, we have helped find durable solutions for tens of millions of refugees ...the number of refugees of concern to UNHCR stood at 10.4 million refugees at the beginning of 2013, down slightly from a year earlier....half in Asia and some 28 per cent in Africa.

	<p>	 </p>
<blockquote>	The terms asylum-seeker and refugee are often confused: an asylum-seeker is someone who says he or she is a refugee, but whose claim has not yet been definitively evaluated...Those judged through proper procedures not to be refugees, nor to be in need of any other form of international protection, can be sent back to their home countries.

	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 1) Get some general background  </h4>
	<p>	Try  the UNHCR website:  <a href="http://www.unhcr.org/"> (link) </a> </p>
<ul><li>	 e.g. how many refugees/asylum seekers in the world.  </li>
<li>	 e.g. how many in Japan? Do you notice anything about the numbers? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 2) Choose and research one UNHCR emergency area </h4>
	<p>	Choose one of these:  <a href="http://data.unhcr.org/"> (link) </a> </p>
	<p>	Do NOT choose "Mediterranean" (too many countries - makes it impossible to write section 1) </p>
<h4>	 Follow the essay pattern </h4>
