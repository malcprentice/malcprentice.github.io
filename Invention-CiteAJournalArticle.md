# ReferenceJournal articles 

For Academic Journal (学術雑誌/論文誌) articles 


## Citing journal articles. 
* Follow the basics: 
    * Cite as much of the date as you can find
        * Penguins are cute (Suzuki, 2023).
        * Even if there is a month or a day, don't give it. 
            * Penguins are cute ~~(Suzuki, 2023, April 23).~~
            * Penguins are cute ~~(Suzuki, 2023, April).~~
    * Journal articles __always__ have a date and an author. Never use "n.d.", never use titls. 
        * Penguins are cute ~~(Suzuki, n.d.)~~
        * Penguins are cute ~~("Penguins overview," n.d.)~~
        * If you can't find author/date, ask me. 
    * You could also try Sentence Style 
        * According to Suzuki (2023), penguins are cute. 
        * See [Invention-CiteSentenceStyle](Invention-CiteSentenceStyle)
* Remember
    * Journal name and volume number get italics. Not issue number in brackets. 
    * There isn't always an issue number
    * Not sure what the numbers mean? Usually: 
        * Journal volume = how many years old is this journal
        * Journal issue = how many issues this year
        * e.g. _89_(3) usually means "Fall issue of an 89 year old journal"
