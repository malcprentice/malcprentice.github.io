## Step 3: Learn some sentence patterns. 
### Read the pattern

> **This paragraph summarises a book called** "1", **which was written by** 2 **in** 3. **It's about** 4, **who is a** 5, **and is set in/at/on** 6.  **The other characters are** 7A (description,), 7B (description) **and** 7C (description). **At the beginning of the book,** 8. **However,** 9. **No spoilers, but** 10. **I think the moral of the story is that** we should/shouldn't 11. **In summary, this was a** 12 **book, so you should (not) read it.**
### Read the example
> **This paragraph summarises a book called** "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban", **which was written by** J.K. Rowling **in** 1999. **It's about** Harry Potter, **who is a** wizard, **and is set** in a magical school called Hogwarts.  **The other characters are** Ron (his friend), Hermione (another friend), Lupin (his godfather) **and** Voldemort (the enemy). **At the beginning of the book,** Harry as usual goes to school and takes classes. **However,** they learn that a prisoner called Sirius Black escaped and there are dementors everywhere. **No spoilers, but** they learn a new skill to defeat the enemy, and many secrets are revealed. **I think the moral of the story is that** we shouldn't not judge people by their appearances. **In summary, this was an** interesting **book, so you should read it.**


Be careful - for each sentence:

* does the example use past (過去) or present tense (現在)? 
* e.g. is (8) Go or Went?

## Tips

This is the secret to ALL WRITING:

* read an example or two 
* find the pattern
* add your own content 

Not all paragraphs or books will match this pattern. 

In class, ask in research week if you want to switch or add something and I will help
