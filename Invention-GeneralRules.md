# General Rules

## Check the references list format
* Times New Roman
* 12 pt
* Double spaced
* Burasage 



## If there is no author name, use the title
* In text or on slide
    * ("Title," 2022)
    * ("Title," 2022, April 3)
    * ("Title," n.d.)
* In references section/slide
    * Title of news article. (2022). *Title of News Source.* http://fakewebsite.com/asdf.html
    * *Title of nameless website article.* (2022, April 3). Title of Website Source. http://fakewebsite.com/asdf.html
    * *Title of nameless dateless website article.* (n.d.). Title of Website Source. Retrieved April 27, 2022, from http://fakewebsite.com/asdf.html

## If there is no date, use "n.d."
* In text or on slide
    * (Suzuki, n.d.)
    * ("Title," n.d.)
* In references section/slide, give the date you SAW it first
    * Suzuki, H. (n.d.). Title of news article. *Title of News Source.* Retrieved April 27, 2022, from http://fakewebsite.com/asdf.html
    * Suzuki, H. (n.d.). *Title of website article.* Title of Website Source. Retrieved April 27, 2022, from http://fakewebsite.com/asdf.html

## If you give two citations on one sentence/slide (e.g. TED+News) 
* Use a semicolon
* (citation1; citation 2)
* TED and news (Suzuki, 2020, April; Yamamoto, 2021, April 3)
* Book and no-date website (Smith, 2021; "Title," n.d.)

## Common Mistakes
* No double dates. If you have a date, don't use "Retrieved"
    * *Title of nameless dateless website article.* (2022, April 27). Title of Website Source. ~~Retrieved April 27, 2022, from~~ http://fakewebsite.com/asdf.html
    * *Title of nameless dateless website article.* (2022, April 27). Title of Website Source. http://fakewebsite.com/asdf.html
