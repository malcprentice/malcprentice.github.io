        <h2 id="Aim ">	Aim  </h2>
	<p>	We will write an essay about ethical consumption (倫理的消費) and learn why we need to think carefully about people and the environment before we buy things. </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	By the end of this project you will be able to: </p>
<ul><li>	 Know more about how the things you buy change the world </li>
<li>	 Write an academic essay in English  </li>
<ul><li>	 Research it and take notes </li>
<li>	 Arrange your research well </li>
<li>	 Write sentences in academic English style </li>
<li>	 Format (フォーマット) it well </li>
<li>	 Cite your sources (出典を引用します) in "APA style" (アメリカ心理学会論文作成) </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Contents">	 Contents </h2>
<ul><li>	 This project will take WEEKS.  </li>
<li>	 Follow your syllabus for Homework 1, 2, 3, etc </li>
<li>	 Don't read ahead too far! I need to explain some things for each homework. </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	If you have problems understanding, translate this page, then ask </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Project Homework  1 - Introduction ">	 Project Homework  1 - Introduction  </h2>
<ul><li>	 You <strong> do not have to submit anything </strong> for Homework 1.  </li>
<li>	 Just think, read, listen and <strong> take notes </strong> </li>
<li>	 Email me if you have questions.  </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Homework 1A: think and understand">	 Homework 1A: think and understand </h3>
<h4>	 We buy/use a lot of different products every day </h4>
<ul><li>	 food every day </li>
<li>	 clothes every month </li>
<li>	 electronics (e.g. phone) every few years </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 However, this can be bad for: </h4>
<ul><li>	 the people/places where they are collected </li>
<li>	 the people/places where they are produced </li>
<li>	 the people/places where they are recycled </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Think about these questions: </h4>
	<p>	Click the links <em>only if you do not understand the question </em> </p>
<ul><li>	 You don't need to read the article - just enough to understand  </li>
<li>	 They are difficult, so translation is OK </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	How often is the answer "I don't know"? </p>
<ul><li>	 Were your clothes made by children?  <a href="https://www.unicef.org/csr/garments.html"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Was your phone made in a safe factory?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_suicides"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Do the eggs you eat come from a happy chicken?  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=free++range++chicken&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Were your cosmetics tested on animals?   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_cosmetics_on_animals"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Is there palm oil in your toothpaste?  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_and_environmental_impact_of_palm_oil"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Will your phone be recycled properly?:  <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/burning-truth-behind-e-waste-dump-africa-180957597/"> (link) </a> </li>

<h3 id=" Homework 1B:  Watch this 11 min video">	 Homework 1B:  Watch this 11 min video </h3>
	<p>	Take notes.  </p>
	<p>	It's difficult, so if you don't understand: </p>
<ul><li>	 Turn on English subtitles (字幕) </li>
<li>	 If you still don't understand, turn on Japanese subtitles  </li>
<li>	 If you used Japanese, watch it AGAIN with English  </li>

<h3 id=" Homework 1C: Read the example essay ">	 Homework 1C: Read the example essay  </h3>
<ul><li>	 Read this: <a href="Examples - example ethical consumption essay.html">example ethical consumption essay</a> </li>
<li>	 We will write an essay like this  </li>
<li>	 Don't worry!  </li>
<ul><li>	 The essay was written by a student. You can do this too! </li>
<li>	 We will do it <strong> slowly, </strong> step by step over WEEKS. No rush! </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Project Homework 2 - choose a topic ">	 Project Homework 2 - choose a topic  </h2>
<ul><li>	 Don't worry!  </li>
<li>	 You are not researching the whole essay!  </li>
<li>	 Just do enough to decide - is your topic good or not? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Important - common mistake">	 Important - common mistake </h3>
<ul><li>	 Topic is problems caused for <strong> other </strong> people/environment </li>
<li>	 Problems <em>for you </em> are NOT the topic.  </li>
<li>	 You can just stop buying/eating it.  </li>
<li>	 Workers can't stop making/farming it </li>
<li>	 For example: </li>
<ul><li>	 NO: "tobacco gives people cancer"    </li>
<li>	 YES: "tobacco farms use child labour"  </li>
<li>	 NO: "eating hamburgers makes me fat"   </li>
<li>	 YES: "meat production is a cause of global warming" </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 1) Make a list of products   </h4>
<ul><li>	 things you used this week </li>
<li>	 things you buy regularly </li>
<li>	 things you have at home </li>
<li>	 things you want to buy </li>
<li>	 things you use <strong> at least once a month. </strong> </li>
<li>	 things that comes from overseas, probably a third world country </li>
<li>	 things you buy things in (packaging) </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 2) Make a list of things INSIDE the things on your list </h4>
<ul><li>	 Inside your product are many materials(材料) </li>
<li>	 Usually, these are worse than finished products.  </li>
<li>	 e.g. palm oil in toothpaste </li>
<li>	 e.g. tantalum in iPhones </li>
<li>	 e.g. wood pulp in notebooks </li>
<li>	 e.g. cotton in t-shirts </li>
<li>	 e.g. shrimp in onigiri </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 3) Choose a good essay topic from your list </h4>
	<p>	Choose something SIMPLE or a material (材料) </p>
	<p>	Do not choose: </p>
<ul><li>	 any endangered animal products (that's essay 2) </li>
<ul><li>	 e.g. no endangered tuna species </li>
<li>	 e.g. no elephant ivory </li>
</ul><li>	 any products I used as an example </li>
<ul><li>	 not palm oil (the example essay) </li>
<li>	 not tantalum (the video) </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 5) Research your topic A LITTLE </h4>
	<p>	You will research more later.  </p>
	<p>	Now, research <strong>  </strong> just enough </strong> to check it is a good topic: </p>
<ul><li>	 Google your topic </li>
<li>	 Research in Japanese/your language is OK.  </li>
<li>	 Read ANYTHING, even bad sources like Wikipedia </li>
<li>	 Notes in Japanese/your language are OK.  </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Is this a good topic or not? </p>
<ul><li>	 Is it interesting  </li>
<li>	 Does it cause <strong> three </strong> problems </li>
<ul><li>	 e.g. pollution, child labour, conflict </li>
<li>	 e.g. poverty, dangerous working conditions </li>
</ul><li>	 Does it have  <strong> three </strong> solutions </li>
<ul><li>	 e.g. NGO, NPO, laws </li>
<li>	 e.g. reduce reuse recycle </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 6) Email Malc your idea to check </h4>
	<p>	You should be able to write: </p>
<ul><li>	 "I chose TOPIC" </li>
<li>	 "TOPIC is ... It ..." </li>
<li>	 "There are at least three problems, for example 1, 2, and 3" </li>
<li>	 "There are at least three solutions, for example 1, 2, and 3." </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	For example </p>
<blockquote>	 <strong> I chose </strong> Tantalum. Tantalum <strong> is </strong> a kind of metal used in electronic devices. It comes from Ghana. <strong> There are at least three solutions, for example </strong> child soldiers, death in mines, and pollution. <strong> There are at least three solutions, for example </strong> fair trade phones, recycling, and UNICEF's work in the Congo" </blockquote>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Project Homework 3 - Research your product and problems">	 Project Homework 3 - Research your product and problems </h2>
	<p>	Now, research your topic, problems, solutions in detail </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Learn how to find good sources">	 Learn how to find good sources </h3>
	<p>	A very detailed look is here: <a href="Invention - find good sources.html">find good sources</a> </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	However, the short version is:  </p>
<ul><li>	 Focus on good sources </li>
<ul><li>	 newspaper articles </li>
<li>	 government reports </li>
<li>	 NGO websites </li>
</ul><li>	 Avoid bad sources </li>
<ul><li>	 No Dictionaries </li>
<li>	 No Wikipedia, no Wikis, no pedias, including Encyclopaedias. </li>
<li>	 No "question answering" sites (Quora, Yahoo, About.com) </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Japanese OK? </h4>
<ul><li>	 Yes, using Japanese sources is OK </li>
<li>	 BUT take notes in English! </li>
<ul><li>	 Do not copy-paste English notes! </li>
<li>	 Read, understand, and write your own notes </li>
<li>	 Write keywords, not sentences </li>
</ul><li>	 In your essay, I want <strong> 50% English sources </strong> </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Homework 3A: Research What is your product?">	 Homework 3A: Research "What is your product?" </h3>
<ul><li>	 Where does it come from? </li>
<li>	 Who makes it? </li>
<li>	 What is it used for? </li>
<li>	 How is it made? </li>
<li>	 How is it similar or different to something we know better? </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" Homework 3B: Research Problems (Cause-Effect)">	 Homework 3B: Research Problems (Cause-Effect) </h3>
<h4>	 Think about the WHOLE LIFE of the product </h4>
<ul><li>	 Preparations (e.g. deforestation by fire) </li>
<li>	 Collection (e.g. mining pollution, slave labour) </li>
<li>	 Production (e.g. suicide by workers, factory collapses) </li>
<li>	 Recycling (e.g. pollution  <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/30/world/asia/china-electronic-waste-e-waste/"> (link) </a> ) </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Think about the effect on people </h4>
<ul><li>	 People producing/collecting/assembling/recycling the thing </li>
<li>	 People displaced from the land used </li>
<li>	 People living near the place it is made/recycled </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Think about the effect on the environment </h4>
<ul><li>	 animals </li>
<li>	 plants </li>
<li>	 soil </li>
<li>	 air </li>
<li>	 water </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h2 id=" Project Homework 4 - Research your solutions and responses">	 Project Homework 4 - Research your solutions and responses </h2>
	<p>	Find at least three solutions </p>
	<p>	Choose solutions that are happening NOW, not in the past or future </p>
	<p>	Solutions are usually: </p>
<ul><li>	 Things students can do </li>
<li>	 Things NGOs, governments, etc, are doing </li>
<li>	 Things companies are doing  </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Some ideas for researching solutions </h4>
<ul><li>	 Labelling laws (dolphin safe tuna) </li>
<li>	 Fairtrade and similar programs </li>
<li>	 Any NGO working on the problem </li>
<li>	 Any NGO working on a related problem (poverty) </li>
<li>	 Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, or avoid completely </li>
<li>	 Part of purchase goes to charity e.g.  <a href="http://www.red.org/en/"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 Making laws </li>
<ul><li>	 International (UN) law </li>
<li>	 National (e.g. Japan) law </li>
<li>	 Companies voluntary codes </li>
</ul><li>	 Activism </li>
<ul><li>	 Campaign/Awareness solutions (letter writing). </li>
<li>	 Boycott / Protest </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Some ideas for researching Responses  </h4>
	<p>	In your essay, you will write sentences like </p>
<ul><li>	 "However, this solution is only partly effective, because..." </li>
<li>	 "In fact, this solution is working very welll - for example... </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Research which one you will use for each solution!  </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Do your solutions actually work?  </p>
	<p>	If they were all perfect there wouldn't be a problem.  </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Probably: </p>
<ul><li>	 They only work in one country </li>
<li>	 They only work 20% </li>
<li>	 They haven't been working very long </li>
<li>	 There are problems with corruption </li>
<li>	 They don't have enough money </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
