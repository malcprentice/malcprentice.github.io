	<p>	Substances are usually worse than final products. The factory that makes earphones might not be a problem, but the metals from Africa used to make them probably are: </p>
<ul><li>	 e.g. tungsten in light bulbs </li>
<li>	 e.g. cotton in your t-shirts </li>

<h3 id=" 5) Choose a good topic from you list">	 5) Choose a good topic from you list </h3>
	<p>	Good essay topics are usually: </p>
<ul><li>	 things that are simple, usually substances  </li>
<li>	 list from step 4 usually better than step 3 </li>
<ul><li>	 e.g. palm oil, not toothpaste </li>
<li>	 e.g. tantalum, not iPhones </li>
<li>	 e.g. trees in Malaysia, not notebooks </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	Do not choose: </p>
<ul><li>	 things that are NOT endangered animals (that's essay 2!) </li>
<ul><li>	 e.g. no tuna </li>
<li>	 e.g. no ivory </li>
</ul><li>	 something I used as an example </li>
<ul><li>	 do not choose palm oil (the example essay) </li>
<li>	 do not choose tantalum (the video) </li>
</ul><li>	 complicated things with many parts and substances </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h3 id=" 6) Research your topic A LITTLE">	 6) Research your topic A LITTLE </h3>
	<p>	Research enough to know if it's a good topic or not </p>
	<p>	Research in Japanese is OK. Notes in Japanese are OK.  </p>
	<p>	Make sure it will be easy to write about: </p>
<ul><li>	 cause at least three problems </li>
<li>	 have at least three solutions </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<ul><li>	 You should be able to say: </li>
<ul><li>	 "I chose TOPIC" </li>
<li>	 "TOPIC is a kind of... It is..." </li>
<li>	 "It causes three problems - 1, 2, and 3" </li>
<li>	 "I have maybe found 5 solutions so far. The best 3 are 1, 2, and 3." </li>
</ul><li>	 For example </li>
<ul><li>	 "I chose Tantalum" </li>
<li>	 "Tantalum is a kind of metal. It is used in electronic devices. It comes from Ghana" </li>
<li>	 "It causes three problems - it funds conflict, the mining is dangerous, and it causes pollution" </li>
<li>	 "I have maybe found 5 solutions so far. The best 3 are all NGOs which are working in the DCR." </li>

<h4>	 Focus on good sources </h4>
<ul><li>	 newspaper articles </li>
<li>	 government reports </li>
<li>	 NGO websites </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 You will present your research over the next two weeks </h4>
<ul><li>	 Do the first research in Japanese </li>
<ul><li>	 take rough handwritten notes </li>
<li>	 take notes in English </li>
<li>	 Do not copy paste </li>
<li>	 Write keywords, not sentences </li>
</ul><li>	 Later </li>
<ul><li>	 we will do more research in English </li>
<li>	 we will type up our notes in English (Essay Outline Template) </li>

</ul>
</ul>	<p>	 </p>
	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 Focus on what you know </h4>
	<p>	Your major can help you research. Focus on what you know: </p>
<ul><li>	 e.g. technological topics/solutions (Engineering) </li>
<li>	 e.g. trade agreement Solutions (Business) </li>
<li>	 e.g. legal solutions (Law) </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 When researching why solutions don't work (RESPONSE) </h4>
<ul><li>	 Corruption </li>
<li>	 There is a law, but police don't/can't enforce it (e.g. trade in animal parts) </li>
<li>	 Solution causes new problems, worse that old:  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/amywestervelt/2012/04/25/can-recycling-be-bad-for-the-environment/"> (link) </a> </li>
<li>	 The solution works, but is not widespread or effective (e.g. what percentage of coffee is Fairtrade now?) </li>

</ul>	<p>	 </p>
<h4>	 <red>Avoid this common mistake</red>: </h4>
<ul><li>	 The focus of this article is problems that <strong> you </strong> cause for <strong> other </strong> people/places/things </li>
<li>	 Problems caused <em>for you </em> are NOT the topic.  </li>
<li>	 If something you buy causes you problems, you can just stop buying it. </li>
<li>	 The people who make things can't stop making them, though.  </li>

</ul><li>	  <strong> Think about the effect on people </strong> </li>
<ul><li>	 People producing/collecting/assembling/recycling the thing </li>
<li>	 People displaced from the land used </li>
<li>	 People living near the place it is made/recycled </li>
</ul><li>	  <strong> Think about the effect on the environment </strong> </li>
<ul><li>	 animals </li>
<li>	 plants </li>
<li>	 soil </li>

<li>	 Farming methods labels (e.g. free range chicken/eggs) </li>
</ul><li>	 Reduce, Re-use, Recycle, or avoid completely </li>
<ul><li>	 Use less of something </li>

<li>	 Avoid it (go vegetarian, keep using your old phone) </li>
<li>	 Recycling things you use (e.g. batteries, PET, cans) </li>
