## Style: Write a Paragraph Summary-Link
There are many kinds of summary. This page is about ENDING of paragraphs and sections in essays

* The last sentences of every paragraph should be either:
    * a summary (e.g. "In summary...")
    * a link (e.g. "The next paragraph...")
    * both summary and link
    * neither 
 

## Examples from writing projects 1 and 2
* Intro
    * Neither!
    * Intro ends with [thesis statement](Style-WriteAThesisStatement) 
* Description (link only, summarising description is hard)
    * The next paragraph looks at some problems production of Tantalum is causing
    * The next paragraph looks at some issues plastic bags are causing
    * The next paragraph looks at some problems copper recycling is causing
    * The next paragraph looks at some of the problems the Sumatran orangutan is facing.
