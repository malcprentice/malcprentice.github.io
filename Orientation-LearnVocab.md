# Learn Vocabulary

## 1) Find the recommended word list
* The vocabulary sheet link will be posted in Google Classroom. 
* That is YOUR copy - you can edit it. 
* I will explain the lists in class. 

## 2) Choose words to learn
* Read down the list
* Find lines you do not know. 
* COpy them into your own blank sheet
* Keep going until you have enough words
* Unless I tell you otherwise, learn 10 words per class

## 3) Study!
* Don't just copy, study! 
* Any method is OK. For example:
    * Just study your list  
    * Use Word cards (単語カード)
    * Write sentences 
    * Copy each word 10 times
    * Upload your list to Memrise
    * Upload your list to  Quizlet
* Any method is OK, but also keep the original list 
    * Your partner needs a list to test you in class 
    * We need a list at the end of term to make your final test 

## 4) Homework Checks and Assessment
* I will check V1. No points, just feedback. 
* I will check your vocab homework at  Mid Term 
    * (see schedule for date)
    * Missing words = minus 1 point
* You will test you partner in class every week
    *  no minus points, 
    * but scoring 2/10 is maybe embarrassing!
* End of term test. 
    * I will check you have all words
        * See syllabus for date and % of your grade 
        * Missing word = 0 points
    * I will test 10 words randomly chosen from all your words. 
        * 5 words Japanese-English translation
        * 5 words English-Japanese translation
        * One spelling mistake OK (not two)
        * Must be correct POS (品詞)
        * Translations with same meaning OK
