    * Copy each word 10 times
    * Upload your list to Memrise

* Any method is OK, but also keep the original list

    * We need a list at the end of term to make your final test 

## 4) Homework Checks and Assessment
* I will check V1. No points, just feedback.

    * (see schedule for date)
    * Missing words = minus 1 point
* You will test you partner in class every week
    *  no minus points, 
    * but scoring 2/10 is maybe embarrassing!
* End of term test. 
    * I will check you have all words
        * See syllabus for date and % of your grade 
        * Missing word = 0 points
    * I will test 10 words randomly chosen from all your words.
