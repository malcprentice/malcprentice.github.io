## CLarification language

See orientation sheet

## "Do you have any questions for us"
* Don't say no. Always have a question ready. 
* Best if at least one is specific to the company and shows that you researched them. 
* For ideas, just [google](https://www.google.com/search?q=questions+to+ask+at+the+end+of+a+job+interview) - there are many lists online. 
* Avoid some questions until you get the job. 
    * "WHen do I get holidays"  
    * "How much money"
    * etc. 

## General tips

* Give full answers. Often this means one or more short story (see below)
* Don't say too little or too much. 
* This is a presentation Eye contact, Voice volume/tone/rhythym/speed, gestures. 
* Phrases from cover letter are similar (I was responsible for X and frequently did Y), but you can use less formal language. 

## Practice

* 1 - Tell a story giving an example from your life to answer one of the skill/personality questions
    * background (what happened / what was needed / why / where/ who/ when)
    * time-order story (what did you do about it)
    * Outcome (how it all worked out, or how you would do better now)
* 2 - Invent a weakness that makes you sound good. 
    * What is the weakness
    * An example of how it caused you problems
    * WHat you did to solve it
    * Outcome (you're better)
* 3 - Questions. Write some questions you could ask at the end of an interview
