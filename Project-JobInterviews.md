## General tips

* Give full answers. Often this means one or more short story (see below)
* Don't say too little or too much. 
* This is a presentation Eye contact, Voice volume/tone/rhythym/speed, gestures. 
* Phrases from cover letter are similar (I was responsible for X and frequently did Y), but you can use less formal language. 

## Practice

* 1 - Tell a story giving an example from your life to answer one of the skill/personality questions
    * background (what happened / what was needed / why / where/ who/ when)
    * time-order story (what did you do about it)
    * Outcome (how it all worked out, or how you would do better now)
* 2 - Invent a weakness that makes you sound good. 
    * What is the weakness
    * An example of how it caused you problems
    * WHat you did to solve it
    * Outcome (you're better)
* 3 - Questions. Write some questions you could ask at the end of an interview
* 4 - Clarification
    * If you can't zhear a question, what do you say?
    * If you realise you didn't answer the question, what do you say?
