# Project - Do a Reading Sprint

## What is a reading sprint?

* Sometimes, your eyes are trained to move too slowly and carefully. 
* Not all reading needs to be slow and careful. 
* Let's see how fast you can go! 
* The aim is to improve your automatic 


## How to do a reading sprint
* Set a timer for 3 minutes
    * Read for 3 minutes at your normal speed
    * Count how many lines you have read. This is your LINE COUNT
    * If you read fast, count pages instead!
* Set a timer for two minutes
    * Count the LINE COUNT forward in the book again, and mark it
    * Try to read that amount in TWO minutes
* Set a timer for ONE minute
    * Count the LINE COUNT forward in the book again, and mark it
    * Try to read that amount in ONE minute
* Set a timer for three minutes
    * Read at your normal speed
    * Is your normal speed now faster?

## What next? 
* Try the speed reading activity (ask me where to find materials in class)
* Just read more. More graded readers, more easy news. Links under "Resources"
