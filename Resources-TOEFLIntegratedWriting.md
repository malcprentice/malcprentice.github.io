# TOEFL Integrated Writing

## Overview and Timing
* Read a passage 
	* (230-300 words, 3 mins)   
	* Look for the Thesis (Paragraph 1). Is it:
		* A policy
		* A practice
		* A position on an issue
	* Take rough notes. The reading comes back, so you can get details later. 
	* Instead, look for the three points (Paragraph 2,3,4) 
		* Reasons it is true / works / worked / is useful / good / 
		* Reasons it is not true / does not work / is not useful
	* Check tense - is this NOW or in the past?
* Listen to a lecture on the same topic 
	* (1-2 minutes)  
	* Listen for the Thesis Statement
	* Listen for 3 points that match the 3 points in the reading  
	* Take detailed notes - the listening does not come back. 
	* Listen for what the listening is DOING
		* disagree =  “casts doubt”, “challenges”, "answers", "contrasts", "differs"
		* agree = it “adds to”, ”supports”, "strengthens" 
* Take off your headset. Listening is done until the end of the test
* 20 mins to type an answer 
	* e.g. 2 mins planning, 16 mins writing, 2 mins checking)
	* For each point in the reading, compare points on listening notes

# Arrangement and Style

## Paragraphs

* Most of the "high level" ETS examples are 4-6 paragraphs. But IT IS NOT NECESSARY - if your essay is short, one paragraph is OK. 
* If your word count is usually under 200 words, aim for one paragraph 
* If your count is more than 200, maybe do more paragraphs
 
## Thesis Statement 

* NO outline
	* The lecture completely refutes the passage. While the reading states that READINGTHESIS, the lecture says that this is not the case.
	* Both texts deal with THESIS. The reading states that READINGTHESIS. In the lecture, however, the professor LISTENINGTHESIS. (from ETS)
	* Despite claims in the reading that READINGTHESIS, in fact LISTENINGTHESIS.
	* Contrary to the claims in the reading that READING THESIS, the listening states that this is not the case. 
	* The listening completely refutes the claim in the reading that READINGTHESIS, by showing that the reasons/examples given are LISTENING
	* The passage introduced three examples/reasons why READINGTHESIS. However, the lecture disagrees.
* With outline  
	* Contrary to the claims in the reading that READING THESIS because of A, B and C, the listening states that this is not the case. 
	* The listening completely refutes the claim in the reading that READINGTHESIS, by showing that the reasons/examples A, B and C are not true. 
	* The passage introduced three examples/reasons why READINGTHESIS: A, B and C. However, the lecture disagrees.

* The professor also offers a different R. She says L.
* Finally, the reading states R. The lecture on the other hand argues that L.
