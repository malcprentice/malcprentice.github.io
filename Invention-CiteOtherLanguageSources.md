## Read this. Try to guess the rules
> Some authors say that cats are great (Suzuki, 2010) - in fact according to Tanaka (2016, April 2) cats are the best pet. A number of articles surveying cat owners strongly support this opinion ("Neko ga suki," 2010, May 5; Suzuki, n.d.; "Neko ga daisuki," n.d.).
