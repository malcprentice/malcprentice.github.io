## A good example from a previous student
_In answer to Homeschooling question, p251 in old purple Longman TOEFL prep book (p328 in new white edition)_

The lecture completely refutes the passage. While the reading states that homeschooling is not good, the lecture says that this is not true. The reading argues that homeschooled students will not learn as much as children at traditional school, because traditional school children must learn a topic well, whereas homeschooled students are not required to master subject before moving on. However the lecture notes that this is not proven, and in fact many studies proved homeschooled children learn far more. The second argument in the reading is that homeschooled students have less social interaction - that they will be able to meet parents, brothers and sisters only. The lecture contradicts this, noting that students have lots of interaction if their parents arrange it with other homeschooled children and they could in fact have more interaction, as it can happen any time. Finally, the reading states that the curriculum is narrower. It says that traditional schools have more established curriculum and more varieties of subjects. The lecture on the other hand argues that students who learn at home have more variety of topic because they are not limited by school boards. That is why parents can teach anything - for example astronomy, medicine and Chinese. For the above reasons, it is doubtful that homeschooling is bad. In fact, it could be more attractive and parents can give good education to children.

## Example 2

(Thanks to MK in 2021 for example)

The reading and the lecture are both about Rembrandt. Whereas the author of the reading summarises reasons why his painting called Portrait of an Elderly Woman in a White Bonnet might not have been painted by Rembrandt, the lecturer provides three reasons why this is not the case.
First of all, according to the reading, the fur collar depicted in the portrait does not match the standard uniform of a servant women of that time, and there is no way Rembrandt could have overlooked such a detail. However, the lecturer disputes this point. She says that the fur collar was added later by others to increase the value of the portrait.
Secondly, the reading states that despite Rembrandt's reputation for detailed attention to light and shadow, the way illumination is drawn in this portrait is not appropriate. Refuting this, the lecture argues that light and shadow were improperly depicted only in the fur, which was added later as has already been noted. In addition, she argues that light and shadow were drawn properly in the original parts of the painting.
Finally, the reading claims that the portrait is painted on a panel made of multiple pieces of wood, which is not typical of Rembrandt's work. However, the lecturer countered that the original painting was done in a single piece, suggesting that perhaps additional wood panels were later added to the original painting to increase its value.
In conclusion, the main points made in the reading about the possible inauthenticity of this particular painting by Rembrandt are each effectively challenged by the lecturer.
