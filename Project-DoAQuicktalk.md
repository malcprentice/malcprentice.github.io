# Project - Do a Quicktalk

## What is a quicktalk? 

* Maybe you've prepared a Quickwrite before
* Quicktalks are the same, but speaking. 
* The aim is
    * Help your partner practice listening
    * Help you practice speaking
    * Help you practice vocabulary you are learning

## What do I do? 

* For homework
    * CHOOSE a topic 
        * Maybe from the [QW list](Resources-QuickwriteTopics)
        * Maybe something in your life you want to share (e.g. your circle)
        * Maybe something in the news that made you think.
    * THINK about what you might want to say (5 mins)

In class, you will try to talk for 3 mins on the topic. Depending on the class, we might make it longer later.
