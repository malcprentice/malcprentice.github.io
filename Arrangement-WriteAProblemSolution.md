## Tips
* Problems
    * For keywords, use only noun or short noun phrase
    * Details sentence 1 can start any way, but every detail sentence 2 needs to [Use cohesion](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FdSxF6525q800er5g1lmX0RxDZkd2QSqpwPzlh1ZfdU/edit?usp=sharing) e.g. "For example" or "However" or "In addition" 
* Solutions
    * Summary is not that kind of summary. Don't start "In summary"
    * Always link to the response showing the solution is good  (However, etc) or bad (In fact, etc) 
    * DO NOT give your own ideas. Save your ideas for the discussion. Summarise what OTHER PEOPLE are ALREADY DOING, then say if it is working or not. 
        * (e.g. summarisehow plastic recycling works, then: 
            * Good "In fact, 91% of PET bottles in Japan are now recycled") 
            * Bad "However, 87% of non-PET plastic is just burned"
    * What to look for (negative)
        * not fully effective "However, only 7% of the product sold is Fair Trade, so"
        * not ready yet       "However, the project will not start until 2019, so "
        * bad assumptions     "However, this solution assumes that poor children all live in cities."
        * Low effort          "However, for each $100 profit, the company only spends 0.3c on "
        * bad research        "However, the data supporting this is very old"
        * missing data        "However, the NGO offers no data on"
        * Bias                "However the research was funded by the company who makes it."
        * Greenwashing        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing
    * What to look for (positive)
        * Preferably, from a source that is NOT the company doing the solution
            * e.g. review websites
            * e.g. news reports about them
        * a number (17%, 300 children, 1200 pairs of shoes every month)
