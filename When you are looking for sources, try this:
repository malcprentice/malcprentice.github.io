# Invention - Find Good Sources 

When you are looking for sources, try this:

## 1) Find the main idea keywords
* Read the Japanese Wikipedia page
* Google the topic in Japanese
* Translate the main idea keywords into English.
* Make a list:

## 2) Now search for those keywords for your specific context

For example, in animals essay, use the country-keyword combination

* e.g. Bengal Tiger hunting 
* e.g. Galapagos penguin global warming
* e.g. plastic bags sea pollution
* e.g. Syrian Refugee destruction of hospitals

### Search options
* Various Googles
    * Google English: https://google.com
    * Google Japanese: https://google.co.jp
    * Google News: http://news.google.com
    * Google Scholar (academic articles): http://scholar.google.com 
* Remember you can
    * Limit it to governmental sites ("site:gov" or "site:.gov.jp"
    * Limit it to university sites ("site:ac.jp" or "site:ac.jp")
    * Limit it to recent articles using Search Tools
    * Limit it to exact matches with quotes "". See the difference this makes:
        * amazon "ngo japan"
        * "amazon ngo" japan
* Alternatives to Google
    * Environmentally friendly search: https://www.ecosia.org/
    * Eric (academic) http://www.eric.ed.gov/
    * Ethos (British Dissertations) http://ethos.bl.uk/
    * ARDR (Japanese dissertations) https://dbr.nii.ac.jp     
    * Reading lists prepared by experts e.g. http://www.readinglists.manchester.ac.uk/index.html
    * Browse top journals on your topic: http://www.journalindicators.com/indicators

### Tip: Access and paywalls
* You might need to be AT UNIVERSITY (or use a VPN) for some things
* Check Google Scholar "all versions"
* To get books
    * Check your own library OPAC 
    * Download a sample chapter from Google Books or Amazon Kindle
    * Find copies in nearby libraries: http://ci.nii.ac.jp/books/

## 4) Save the good sources
* You probably found too much.
    * Journals: Read the abstracts. Only download and read references that are useful for you.
    * News etc: Skim it quickly before you read.  
* Save the PDF (or PRINT the web page as PDF)
    * It's easier to take notes on a PDF
    * If the original article is moved,you still have it
## 5) Follow the sources back
* Good wikipedia article? Read the links at the bottom
* Good journal article? Read the references list. 
* Good Google Scholar item
    * Click "cited by" (e.g. " 引用元") or related article (関連記事)
    * choose popular ones - if older article have few citations, they’re not important
    * "引用元 6893", not "引用元 1"
 
## Tip: Judge quality of an academic article 
* Some questions to ask:
    * Is anyone citing it? (Google Scholar has a count. Take into account age.)
    * Is it recent enough (philosophy and engineering articles age at different speeds)
    * How good is the source? 
* Quality articles/books are usually published by:
    * Large university publishers like www.cambridge.org
    * Large academic organisations like www.apa.org
    * Large open-source projects like www.plosone.org/
    * Large academic publishing companies: Ingenta/Sciencedirect, Degruyter, Ingenta, Wiley
    * High impact factor journals e.g. www.journalindicators.com/indicators
* Bad sources are more likely to be on
* Self published books http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/Pay-to-publish 
    * Individual websites, blogs
    * Single topic conspiracy groups: creation dot com, inconvenient history dot com (links spelled out because I don't want to link to them)
    * However, it depends. Some small groups are good, some big ones are bad, some researchers have good quality blogs to share their research. 
    * Learn the names of quality sources for your area.
