Exact formatting is hard to describe - while you read this, look at the example file in Shared Materials folder  ("Style - using figures and tables.docx")

##  APA rules for Tables and Figures
* Always refer to ANY figure/table at least once in the text 
	* ("As Figure 1 shows", "As Table 3 indicates")
	* See [[Style - describe figures and tables]]
* Don't forget units (kg,m,s)
* Explain any abbreviations in a note BELOW the item. Start the note with "Note." I should be able to understand your table/figure without reading the article
* Don't use titles built into Excel/Word graphs. Delete that and add your own typed title.
* Make sure your title, figure, notes are all on the same page.


##  APA rules for For Figures
* Give the title BELOW
* Title should stand alone,
* Include the raw data in an appendix if you can
* Use the right type of chart/graph
	* Pie charts = 100% of something
	* Graphs = change over time
	* Bar charts = comparing amounts
	* Label axes (Number of students passing)
	* Don’t distort the scale
	* x axis is for independent variable
	* Use totals, not percentages


##  APA rules for tables
* Give the Table number ("Table 1")
* On the next line, give the title in italics
* Next, give the table. Give the title ABOVE tables (opposite for figures)
* Title should stand alone, so you need to mention both the X and Y axis ("Increase in Y between time X1 and X2")
* Don't let the table split across pages, or get separated from its title.
* only horizontal lines, and only for headers and bottom
* no vertical lines in APA style
* Leave a blank line between the table and the rest of the text.
* Leave a blank line between the table number and the table.
* Centre align the numbers and column headers inside their columns
* Left align the first column, which contains the row headers
For figures (graphs/charts/maps/photos/diagrams)
* Give the title below “Figure 3: % AWL words by genre”
* Make sure it looks good in Black and White.
