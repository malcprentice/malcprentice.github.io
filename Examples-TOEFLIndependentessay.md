## Example 1 Some people like to live in the mountains, while others would prefer to live near the sea. Which would you prefer? Give reasons to support your response

* When I was young, my family lived near the sea, however we always used to spend some time each summer with my grandmother, and her home was in the mountains. Each place - mountains and sea - has its advantages, but I would prefer to live near the mountain for three reasons - the mountain herbs, the seasons, and the quiet. Firstly, in the mountains, we can enjoy a lot of mountain herbs such as warabi, udo, takenoko, kinoko, and so on. We can pick, cook, and eat them all the time if we live near the mountains. These herbs are very good for health, which also makes living near the mountains healthier than living near the sea. Secondly, if you live near the mountains, you can enjoy the seasons changing more. In spring, you can see some beautiful flowers or cherry trees, while in summer time, you can enjoy a lot of great green trees and not only these, insects such as beetles, cicada, and dragonflies appear. In fall, the green leaves change to red, yellow, and orange - you can see these process happening every day if you live in the mountains. Then in Fall, you can try hiking. If you go, you can take these scenery, and some delicious foods. In Winter, the beautiful leaves are all gone, but the snow-covered trees are very beautiful. The third reason I want to live in the mountains is that it is very quiet there, so you relax and unwind. When I was visiting my grandmother in summer, I often just sat for hours listening to the wind in the trees, with no cars or trains or noises of people. I can understand why some people would prefer to live in the sea - it does have good sports and I do like eating fish - but for the reasons above, I would prefer to live in the mountains. Next holidays I will be taking my driving test in Yamagata, and I hope I can take some time to visit the mountains there. (338 words- Thanks to MY for original)

## Example 2 Some people like to travel without a plan. Others prefer to plan everything before they leave. Which do you prefer? Give reasons and examples. 

* I have gone on several trips with my school, family and friends. Sometimes we travelled with no plan, and other times we had a complete plan. In this essay I will look at planned and unplanned trips, and show that each has advantages. 
* Some people like to travel with no plan, and this does have some advantages. The first benefit is that you can decide yourself when you start and stop something when you visit somewhere. You do not need to worry about managing your time, so you can relax without worrying about having to catch a bus. The second benefit is that you can explore freely and find things you did not expect. For example, when I walked around the streets in Kyoto on a school trip, I found a small but good tea shop on a street. If I had had a plan, I might have walked past it without going in. In short, if you have not made a plan then you are more likely to see and hear new things. 
* While some people travel without a plan, others prefer to have a detailed schedule before they leave home.  The main advantage of this is that you can be efficient and visit all the places you want to see. For example, when I visited Nikko with my family we were able to see all the main sights, and we had extra time to buy souvenirs. Secondly, since you do not have to book hotels or find places, you have more energy to just enjoy your trip.
* I have travelled both with and without making plans and booking things before I leave. I can understand why some people like to travel without a plan because of the freedom it gives. However my holidays are short and I want to make the most of them. For this reason, I prefer to make a careful schedule before I go. This summer I will visit Korea and I am already reading guidebooks and making my plan for the trip. If you are going somewhere this summer, perhaps you should start making plans too.

People are living longer than ever before. They are able to be active even at an older age. It is a topic of debate why this is occurring, and options suggested include technological improvements, changes to education systems, and improvements to our diets. In this essay, I will argue that technological improvements are the main cause of this longevity for two reasons.

First, there is the development of medical care. Compared to the past, many new medicines and medical devices have been developed. Advances in medical technology are helping to improve the efficiency of disease prevention and treatment. I think it is especially important to have technology to detect diseases before they get worse. One example is my grandmother, who was diagnosed with heart disease several years ago. However, since it was detected at an early stage, she was able to be treated immediately. In addition, she was able to finish the treatment without putting too much burden on her body. In this way, advances in medical technology have enabled people to receive treatment before it is too late and maintain good health for longer.

Second, the Internet has made it easier for us to get information about injuries and illnesses. People are not always able to go to the hospital, so this allows us to learn how to avoid health problems and do first aid for injuries. For example, recently, a lot of information about COVID-19 symptoms and vaccines has been posted on the Internet. As a result I could research adverse reactions to the vaccine, and prepared medicines and food beforehand in case I had any symptoms. I actually had a high fever as an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I was able to deal with it quickly. In this way, thanks to the Internet, people are able to maintain their health on their own.

In conclusion, I am convinced that the development of technology is the most important reason why people are able to live longer for the reasons mentioned above. On the other hand, I believe that in developing countries, technology is still not sufficient. Perhaps this is one reason the average life expectancy is lower than in developed countries. Therefore, I think that developed countries should cooperate with developing countries and support more technological development.
