## Example 1 Some people like to live in the mountains, while others would prefer to live near the sea. Which would you prefer? Give reasons to support your response

* When I was young, my family lived near the sea, however we always used to spend some time each summer with my grandmother, and her home was in the mountains. Each place - mountains and sea - has its advantages, but I would prefer to live near the mountain for three reasons - the mountain herbs, the seasons, and the quiet. Firstly, in the mountains, we can enjoy a lot of mountain herbs such as warabi, udo, takenoko, kinoko, and so on. We can pick, cook, and eat them all the time if we live near the mountains. These herbs are very good for health, which also makes living near the mountains healthier than living near the sea. Secondly, if you live near the mountains, you can enjoy the seasons changing more. In spring, you can see some beautiful flowers or cherry trees, while in summer time, you can enjoy a lot of great green trees and not only these, insects such as beetles, cicada, and dragonflies appear. In fall, the green leaves change to red, yellow, and orange - you can see these process happening every day if you live in the mountains. Then in Fall, you can try hiking. If you go, you can take these scenery, and some delicious foods. In Winter, the beautiful leaves are all gone, but the snow-covered trees are very beautiful. The third reason I want to live in the mountains is that it is very quiet there, so you relax and unwind. When I was visiting my grandmother in summer, I often just sat for hours listening to the wind in the trees, with no cars or trains or noises of people. I can understand why some people would prefer to live in the sea - it does have good sports and I do like eating fish - but for the reasons above, I would prefer to live in the mountains. Next holidays I will be taking my driving test in Yamagata, and I hope I can take some time to visit the mountains there. (338 words- Thanks to MY for original) 


## Example 2 Some people like to travel without a plan. Others prefer to plan everything before they leave. Which do you prefer? Give reasons and examples. 

* I have gone on several trips with my school, family and friends. Sometimes we travelled with no plan, and other times we had a complete plan. In this essay I will look at planned and unplanned trips, and show that each has advantages. 
* Some people like to travel with no plan, and this does have some advantages. The first benefit is that you can decide yourself when you start and stop something when you visit somewhere. You do not need to worry about managing your time, so you can relax without worrying about having to catch a bus. The second benefit is that you can explore freely and find things you did not expect. For example, when I walked around the streets in Kyoto on a school trip, I found a small but good tea shop on a street. If I had had a plan, I might have walked past it without going in. In short, if you have not made a plan then you are more likely to see and hear new things. 
* While some people travel without a plan, others prefer to have a detailed schedule before they leave home.  The main advantage of this is that you can be efficient and visit all the places you want to see. For example, when I visited Nikko with my family we were able to see all the main sights, and we had extra time to buy souvenirs. Secondly, since you do not have to book hotels or find places, you have more energy to just enjoy your trip.
* I have travelled both with and without making plans and booking things before I leave. I can understand why some people like to travel without a plan because of the freedom it gives. However my holidays are short and I want to make the most of them. For this reason, I prefer to make a careful schedule before I go. This summer I will visit Korea and I am already reading guidebooks and making my plan for the trip. If you are going somewhere this summer, perhaps you should start making plans too.

People are living longer than ever before. They are able to be active even at an older age. It is a topic of debate why this is occurring, and options suggested include technological improvements, changes to education systems, and improvements to our diets. In this essay, I will argue that technological improvements are the main cause of this longevity for two reasons.

First, there is the development of medical care. Compared to the past, many new medicines and medical devices have been developed. Advances in medical technology are helping to improve the efficiency of disease prevention and treatment. I think it is especially important to have technology to detect diseases before they get worse. One example is my grandmother, who was diagnosed with heart disease several years ago. However, since it was detected at an early stage, she was able to be treated immediately. In addition, she was able to finish the treatment without putting too much burden on her body. In this way, advances in medical technology have enabled people to receive treatment before it is too late and maintain good health for longer.

Second, the Internet has made it easier for us to get information about injuries and illnesses. People are not always able to go to the hospital, so this allows us to learn how to avoid health problems and do first aid for injuries. For example, recently, a lot of information about COVID-19 symptoms and vaccines has been posted on the Internet. As a result I could research adverse reactions to the vaccine, and prepared medicines and food beforehand in case I had any symptoms. I actually had a high fever as an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but I was able to deal with it quickly. In this way, thanks to the Internet, people are able to maintain their health on their own.

In conclusion, I am convinced that the development of technology is the most important reason why people are able to live longer for the reasons mentioned above. On the other hand, I believe that in developing countries, technology is still not sufficient. Perhaps this is one reason the average life expectancy is lower than in developed countries. Therefore, I think that developed countries should cooperate with developing countries and support more technological development.

Q. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? All university students should be required to participate in exercise classes or sports. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.

These days, a lot of university students tend to be busy and have no time to exercise to build their health by themselves. Personally, I believe that all university students should be required to take exercise classes or participate in sports club activities. I feel this way for two reasons, which I will explore in the following essay.

First of all, university students do not have time to control their health by themselves because almost all of them are busy with assignments, part-time jobs, and so on. Almost all university students think that “We are still young, so we do not have to take care of our health too seriously, and we want to hang out more” or “I have countless things to do in order to make my dream come true”. Because of this, they do not have time to do sports. My friend's experience is a compelling example of this. She is living far from our university, so it takes about 2 hours to go to the university, and she has so many things to do in her life. Therefore she cannot make time to do sports or something. And then, her health is not good. Therefore,  I agree that some class time should be allocated.

Secondly, students can make friends  more easily in these kinds of activities than other opportunities in university. Sports have a strong power to connect people, and allow them to make friends. One reason for this is that players need to communicate with each other in order to win, and hold their breath to perform well. For instance, in the P.E class, when I was a high school student, my classmates and I were playing soccer on the ground, and talked to each other a lot during the game, so we had a great time. . Then, I could be friends with my classmates who I did not know well about. As such, for the above two reasons, I am of the opinion that all university students should take exercise classes to be healthier and make good friends.

## Example 5:  (5 paragraph)
In answer to "What famous place would you like to visit? Use details and reasons to support your response." Thanks to MY for the original submitted in 2014

Recently, one of my friends from high school went to Okinawa for a company trip. She told me how nice the prefecture was and I was so interested in her story. Therefore, if I could go to a famous place, I would choose Okinawa for three reasons: its nature, food, and peace.

The first reason why I want to visit Okinawa is that it has great nature. For example, there are rare animals such as the Iriomote cat and the Dugong. I may not be able to see them any other place in Japan, so I would like to encounter those animals. Also, Okinawa has beautiful beaches. I was born and raised in a big city, so I am not familiar with beaches - I heard that I can see star-shaped sand in Okinawa, and I want to bring back some to my home. 

Another point which makes Okinawa adorable is its cuisine. Okinawa food is unique and nice. When I was eating one of them, goya chanpuru with my friend from Okinawa, she said it was not as good as the one made at her home. I am curious about how it differs from Tokyo’s version. Also, I am interested in a food called taco rice. I have never eaten it, but I heard it comes with tomato, lettuce, cheese, and rice and tastes like salad. I cannot imagine it, so I really want to try it and learn how to cook it. 

Finally, in Okinawa, I can learn about peace. I am majoring in peace studies, and knew that Okinawa is only the place in Japan where a war was actually brought during World War II. Many people who were not soldiers were killed, and some of them were forced to commit suicide. Despite those sad histories during the war, they recovered and remade a peaceful island with cultural music and dance. As I am studying about world peace, I think I should know these events and how they recovered.

In conclusion, these days we can go everywhere if only we have time and money. I understand that many people would choose foreign countries such as the US or Australia to go sightseeing. However, still I want to visit Okinawa because I can experience its nature, food, and peace culture. Now I am saving money to attend a study tour held in Okinawa this summer, so hopefully, I will be going to Okinawa soon.
